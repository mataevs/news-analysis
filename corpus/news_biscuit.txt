<title>Public urged to get sent to prison to be away from murderers</title>
<text>
Following a spate of prisoners walking out of an open prison instead of doing the decent thing and finishing his sentence, the public are being urged to get themselves locked up at her majestys pleasure to help keep themselves safe from robbers and murders.

Justice secretary Chris Grayling has said he is disappointed that prisoners cant be trusted to manage their own incarceration, but promised he was doing everything in his power to make sure the public was protected from some of the most dangerous people in society. Ive asked Serco and G4s to do a stock take of all the murderers, armed robbers, and convicted gang members and it turns out there are probably more outside of prison than inside, Grayling said. So just to be on the safe side, we are recommending that any member of the public who wants to be protected by the prison system to commit a crime like not paying your TV License that will see them jailed. Once locked up youll be in the one place in Britain we can be sure doesnt contain any of really dangerous people.

In a true show of justice and punishment the new prisons the will inevitably be required will be built by the bono fide criminals, Grayling said. Just as soon as we can find them.</text>

<title>Political parties given go ahead for new Subliminal Election Broadcasts</title>
<text>
From next year, the traditional Party Election Broadcast will be replaced by a blipvert that operates below the threshold of human conscious perception. The old party political broadcasts suffered from a terrible flaw, explained Tory party strategist Lynton Crosby. As soon as anyone realised they were watching one, they immediately switched over.

Under the new rules, each party will be given a number of prime-time TV slots to access the nations subconscious by flashing up a brief image of their leader lasting less than 30 milliseconds. David Cameron might pop up in the middle of Eastenders grinning and waving some money, Ed Miliband could suddenly appear on Coronation Street looking sternly at an electricity bill, while Nick Clegg may turn up on Hollyoaks under a big neon sign flashing the word Sorry.

UKIP leader Nigel Farage has also been allocated a couple of blipverts that he will use to flash-frame the image of an invading army of 485 million zombie immigrants. Ed Miliband has welcomed the move. I have been using subliminal tactics for some time, he said. In fact I am so below the radar of public consciousness, most people have no idea they have even seen me. Nick Clegg also likes the idea of being able to make any future pledges subliminally, so that no-one will know for certain when he inevitably breaks them.

However, concerns have been raised after a pilot study in which viewers exposed to the ads complained of terrible flashbacks. Some people kept seeing David Camerons big pink face looming ominously towards them, an image so disturbing it caused a number of victims heads to explode. Subliminal ads do carry the risk of post traumatic party political trauma, said psychologist Dr Raj Persaud, but the modest risk of spontaneous cranial combustion is more than offset by never having to sit through a normal length broadcast.

To ensure fair play, the ads will be regulated by the Subliminal Advertising Standards Authority, an organisation about which most people have no awareness. If a blipvert is deemed to have broken electoral guidelines it will be immediately followed by a special cleansing ad that will automatically erase the subconscious memory of the first one.

Subliminal adverts are the future of political campaigning, said Crosby. And very soon everyone will agree with me, even if they have no idea why.</text>

<title>Disgrunted voters create the Independence from the UK Independence Party Party</title>
<text>
Angry Rotherham residents have formed a new political party to free them from the influx of UKIP voters and councillors into their neighbourhood. Called the Independence from the UK Independence Party, er Party, it is looking to trade on the fear and anger caused in the area from last nights UKIP victories. Leader Pamela Tamperly, 42, said, We used to be a nice, close knit community before UKIP came, taking our councillors jobs and threatening those of our MEPs. Send them back, thats what I say. Others in the area have feared for the impact on wages that UKIP voters will have. What chance has anyone got of finding work at a decent rate if employers know that UKIP supporters are in the area? said Barry Griffield, 34. If you can get someone to vote UKIP, then surely theyre stupid enough to work for peanuts as well. Theyre taking our jobs!

The formation of the party came about after support groups began to form this morning, aiming to help people cope in the aftermath of such a shocking transformation to their community and culture. Said Ms Tamperly, People were walking aimlessly around the streets, giving out low moans of distress and sometimes bursting into involuntary floods of tears. This happens quite often in Rotherham anyway, but there seemed to be a lot more of it today, and we decided that something must be done. After sharing our stories, including a number of them from people who thought their neighbours were one of us, only to find that they were, in fact, a dirty, stinking UKIP supporter who you wouldnt even want to live in the same street as, let alone next door to, we decided to take action. The very fabric of our society is under threat. Another supporter with strong religious leanings said that last nights storms were a clear sign that God is angry with our toleration of UKIP and wants us to cast them out.

Policies for the new party include a cap on UKIP supporters in any one area, to prevent them from winning council seats, and a referendum on whether UKIP should be allowed to stand for election. Tamperly said, The government are running scared of UKIP so much that they are now accounting for about 75% of all our laws, which is far more than their electoral popularity should allow for. Weve got to stand up to this tyranny of the unaccountable over our Parliament. When asked about their other policies, they admitted that they hadnt gotten as far as the economy yet, but added that uniforms for taxi drivers were to be prohibited, saying Well protect the rights of taxi drivers to wear whatever they want from the tyranny of these meddlesome UKIP types, who are intent on destroying our basic freedoms. In response, a spokesman for UKIP said EU Brussels bureaucrats, meddlesome metropolitan liberal elite, not afraid to tell it like it is, pint down the pub, opening the floodgates, etc.</text>

<title>BBCs Jezza could topple at any time as more cracks appear</title>
<text>
The BBCs iconic monolith Jezza is in danger of collapsing due to its feet of clay and teeny, weeny, tiny, toe say experts.

The alabastard figure is currently on display in the new Broadcasting House main foyer, but many fear that its instability could bring the whole building crashing about it.

In laymans terms, hes crumbling under his own weight, said one BBC restorer. As each year passes, his feet cannot support the twist and turns of his top-heavy pose. Weve tried filling him in every time he cracks up, but almost immediately another fault appears. Immensely popular antiquated figures like Jezza have to be treated with kid gloves; its almost as if they have a mind of their own. Thats not the BBC way.

However this view is contradicted by spokesman for preservation society The Friends of Jezza, James May. He really hasnt got a nasty bone in his body. In fact, he has no bones. Hes an icon for godssake, said May. He is mighty, he is virile, he is a symbol of all things manly, he is  oh OK, hes just a massive cock.

A worried BBC insider commented; Were all petrified. Jezza may be an institutional icon, but as time goes on the more unstable he becomes. He could go at any time, bringing my pension down with him.</text>

<title>Baboon resigns from UKIP</title>
<text>
A baboon has resigned from UKIP following a fierce debate in the party over its future bananas policies.

Nigel  named after UKIPs charismatic leader  indicated he was leaving the party which, he alleged, has been taken over by a cartload of monkeys.

The resignation follows revelations that two chimpanzees and an orang-utan had left the party amidst claims they had been fiddling their fyffes expenses and following remarks by a UKIP councillor that orang-utans should go back to Pongo-Pongo land.

Labour and the Conservatives have denounced UKIPs attitude as racist while Nick Clegg has challenged Nigel to a televised debate.

Many UKIP members were unaware that the party had a baboon as a member although the party believes that it has strong support from the great ape community.

I saw Nigel  the baboon- at our party conference once or twice, one man said, but quite honestly he looked like any other party member. And he made a damned good speech on withdrawal from the EU.

Other UKIP members were unfazed by Nigels resignation.

Some of my best friends are baboons, said one UKIP Europe candidate, so Im not prejudiced against them, but theres only so much room in Whipsnade. The country just cant cope with a tsunami of marsupials from Africa.

A UKIP spokesman dismissed as slimy rumourmongering a report that two toads and a lizard had also left the party.

And rumours that Nigel the baboon will defect to the Conservative party were strongly rebutted by a Conservative spokesman.

No chance, he said. Weve already got a baboon as Communities Secretary.</text>

<title>Russell Brand broke Paxmans heart</title>
<text>
The veteran presenter and professional cynic has quit BBC Twos Newsnight amid rumours that he had been pining like a dog on heat for the acerbic lothario, Russell Brand.

Jeremy Paxman (63) has confessed privately to colleagues that since his fateful meeting with the comedian on 23 October 2013, he has been unable to sleep, wash or sneer effectively at Nick Clegg.

Described by the Director General, Tony Hall, as a once rare and dazzling talent; Paxman will more likely be remembered for his insipid poems, lovelorn sighs to camera and his knuckle tattoo of I  RB.

Viewers have noted many of his recent interviews have been interrupted by a constant checking of his mobile phone for missed calls or messages. His outbursts of frustration or anger for the smallest thing have been seen as a clear indication of a broken heart, a rejection of two party politics and the onset of irritable bowel syndrome. One newsreader commented: Its not untypical to get besotted with the interviewee. Michael Parkinson embarked on a tempestuous affair with Rod Hulls Emu in the late 70s. There was egg on his face when it came to an end.

A spokesman for James Harding, head of news, said Paxman was a great lion of BBC journalism but a gentle pussycat in the bejewelled hands of philandering Brand. Even his vain attempts to grow a matching beard showed how enthralled Paxman had become to these rakish charms. The BBC confirmed that he will continue to host University Challenge but insisted he must start asking questions other than Whose your favourite star in Forgetting Sarah Marshall?, Can Transcendental Meditation lead to true love? and Whats the alarm code to Russells house?

Only a year ago Brand had electrified the elderly newscaster with the promise of revolution, free love and an end to razor blades. Since then his man crush has gone unrequited, despite attempts to dress as a Katy Perry look-a-like on weekends. Only last week, Kirsty Wark spoke of her concern at Paxmans loss of appetite, feelings of isolation and repeatedly singing Cryin in two part harmony with Roy Orbison.</text>

<title>Mans laptop shuts down for bank holiday weekend</title>
<text>
A laptop belonging to a 28 year old Newcastle man has angered its owner by deciding to take off the bank holiday weekend. I went to fire it up this morning says Dave Hutchins, the owner of the laptop, and when I turned it on a message popped up saying Daves laptop is off for the bank holiday weekend and will return on Tuesday 27th May, if your enquiry cannot wait until then please contact Daves IPad which is currently located behind a cushion on the sofa.

Its been playing up a bit lately and this was the last straw, I got a bit angry and called it a few names that I probably shouldnt have, then I slammed my fist down on the keyboard and the message Caps lock is on came up and this made me really mad so I hit it again and a smiley face came up with C U Next Tuesday written underneath, which was a bit uncalled for I think.</text>

<title>Pro-Russian Ukranians hold unofficial Eurovision vote</title>
<text>
Russian twins The Tolmachevy Sisters have won a landslide victory in the Eurovision Song Contest according to an unofficial poll which took place in areas held by Pro-Russian demonstrators in Eastern Ukraine.

Voting slips featured a photo of The Tolmachevy Sisters accompanied by the Russian flag, while everyone else was represented by a photo of dead WW2 Russians accompanied by a Swastika. After votes were counted, the Russian singing duo were duly declared winners with an impressive 108% of the popular vote.

Although Russia had initially disowned the poll, a Kremlin spokesperson said The vote was free and fair and we fully expect arrangements to be made, by Cossacks, for the next Eurovision to be held in Moscow.

Outside Ukraine, official voting crowned Austrian diva Conchita Wurst winner with her song Rise like a Phoenix, though there were accusations of nepotism as it emerged that countries with large populations of bearded women had all voted for each other.</text>

<title>Debbies Law to reveal if partners have a history of being boring</title>
<text>
A new law that could be passed within months will make men and women aware of previous instances of dullness and boring behaviour in their partners. Named after Debbie Stevens, who discovered her husband Mike had a history of motorway-themed conversation and golf before she divorced him in 2011 having unearthed his hidden subscription to BBC History magazine, the law is designed to protect individuals from partners with a proven history of crushing dullness.

Nobody should have to suffer needlessly in the way Debbie did, said MP Verity Baxter, a prominent campaigner for the law. We estimate there are thousands of individuals in this country enduring relationships with partners whose inherent dullness only emerged some time after they were married or established in a secure relationship.

Instances of wanting to holiday with the neighbours or have a quiet Saturday night in with a takeaway, could all be cited as examples of boring behaviour under the law. Membership of gardening clubs, rock choirs or amateur dramatic societies could also be registered and revealed to inquiring partners.

Any measure that can protect a partner against previously undemonstrated dullness is to be welcomed, said Bruce Farwell, 63. His son Duncan disappeared in 2007 and is believed to have been driven from the family home by his wife Sofies obsession with TV talent shows. Bruce had no inkling as to Sofies dormant dullness until it was too late, Farwell added. If we can save one more husband, wife, girlfriend or boyfriend from a similar fate, then we have a duty to do so.</text>

<title>Men demand multiple orgasms in exchange for equitable pay</title>
<text>
As one of the key electoral issues of the Scottish independence debate emerges, men have said they are willing to concede ground on equal pay provided they are compensated from areas of female monopoly such as extended life-spans, wardrobe space and knee trembling duration. While Shadow Scottish Secretary Margaret Curran has said Labour will publish pay differentials, many men north of the border want greater transparency when it comes to shoe allowance.

The disparity in the length of climax is but one of several areas of injustice impacting on men who for too long have had limited hairstyle and dyeing options. One male executive admitted: Yes, weve been guilty of a few thousand years of discrimination, but its not all been one way traffic. Dont get me started on acne, balding and car insurance. La petite mort needs to be less petite, more grande!

On the international stage, President Obama has recently signed an executive order to target the gender wage gap, but Republicans are insisting he legislates to make it easier for a man to get laid, wear his wifes clothing and pout in a cute way. As one male Senator complained: I will admit that peeing standing up is handy but bear in mind it takes us a lot longer to get drunk in the first place.

While politicians scramble for female votes, very little has been said about erectile dysfunction in the work place. Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond has promised all company boards will comprise of 40% women but has failed to explain why only women can compete in rhythmic gymnastics. An SNP spokesman admitted: Womens pay will never truly be equal until we address the wider concern of why the only erogenous zone men have orgasms just the once, takes hours to re-set and is constantly in need of readjustment.</text>

<title>World reacts with surprising speed to Nigerian abduction  one month later</title>
<text>
With the coiled energy of a tortoise on Prozac, the international community has sprung to the aid of the frantic families of over 200 missing Nigerian schoolgirls. As most crime-fighting agencies will attest, the most auspicious moment to investigate a kidnapping is at least a month after the event. Like a good wine, a bankers pension scheme or the humour of James Corden  hostages improve with time.

It is a well-established fact that evidence, witness reports and genital rashes are all best ignored. A spokesman for the White House said: It doesnt pay to rush these things. These kids could just have been skipping class. A month is no time at all. After all, it took the US two years to join in WW2 and nobody noticed. Whats the hurry?

The latest kidnappings in the village of Warabe, in north-eastern Nigeria, have generated the same urgency displayed by a three-toed sloth wading through treacle. The Obama administration has sent combination of military, law enforcement and fleet of high-speed tractors to deal with the incident. Meanwhile the British Foreign Office has placed the kidnapped schoolgirls on their list of priorities, just below climate change, prosecuting tax evaders and finding Madeleine McCann.

Each kidnapping has involved gunmen seizing animals, food and then lounging around for a fortnight before anyone notices. One Black-Ops agent explained: We prefer a softly, softly approach. We like to call it the Savile technique  we carefully ignore all pleas for help, evidence of wrong doing or creepy looking haircuts, then at the last moment we wait, and then wait some more, for the target to die of natural causesand then we strike! He added: Well get round to this as soon as weve found the Lindbergh kid.</text>

<title>Gove to privatise child abuse</title>
<text>
Michael Gove has announced hell hand responsibility for all child abuse to private companies like G4S, Atos and Serco. Mr Gove told the media it was inappropriate and wrong for past child abuse to be largely the responsibility of public bodies like the BBC, state-run care homes, the NHS and Liberal MP Cyril Smith.

The Education Secretary said: At a time of economic challenge its crucial we dont leave child abuse to Labour-supporting BBC celebrities who are paid millions of pounds by licence fee payers. Even some religious institutions are claiming state funding for their special kind of hurting of children. Equally, the cost of child abuse in local authority and other state-provided institutions has got out of hand. Thats why teachers in Free Schools will have a freer hand in this respect. One simple form of abuse will be to deny children in Free Schools free school meals.

Mr Gove made favourable reference to the economics of child abuse in privately funded independent boarding schools. By choosing to put their children out to tender in boarding schools for which they pay out of their own pockets, wise parents have seen the benefits of market-led cruelty, he told an education conference. Most of the Cabinet have experienced and benefitted from this process and see it as their duty to make sure everyone has similar opportunities. That includes the chance to be bullied in less celebrated private schools. Some victims, tragically, go on to become Liberal Democrat MPs, a disastrous choice they are fully entitled to make.

Mr Gove went on to argue that children from poorer backgrounds shouldnt and wouldnt miss out on opportunities to be sexually interfered with as part of their education. You only have to look at the charitable bursaries available for children from less privileged backgrounds, who show talent in say, music. They can get damaged by inappropriate hands-on behaviour from one-to-one instrumental teachers in private education without a hand out from the state.

The Department of Education has already cited the track records of Atos, Serco and G4S. One official said These companies have already got admirable experience in successfully abusing adults, many of them vulnerable, across a wide range of scenarios, including disability, benefit allocation and killing deportees on aeroplanes. Yet most of the people who carry out this abuse are paid the minimum wage  which represents a considerable saving at a time of austerity.</text>

<title>Football chairmen invest in worlds most expensive merry-go-round</title>
<text>
The biggest, fastest and most costly carousel in the world has been ordered by a group of ambitious football club owners in time for next season. Set in an unfairground just outside the Promised Land, the new ride will entertain some of the richest football managers from around the world between terminated but lucrative contracts. The owners have high hopes that their merry-go-round will become, and remain for several years to come, a premier attraction.

Nicknamed the Magic Roundabout, the ride will transform the damaged reputations of those with massive pay-offs persuaded to climb aboard for another ride. Previously rejected failures will become sought-after successes, the tactically naive will become motivational maestros, and those who have lost dressing rooms in the past will miraculously find their way again. And all it takes apparently is a bit of spinning.

Serial easy rider Harry Redknapp is the manager of Queens Park Rangers until either a play-off defeat, a disappointing start to the season or his discovery of yet another gullible chairman of a Club with more money than sense that he hasnt ripped off previously. In a typically perceptive analysis, Redknapp said of the ride, Im sure itll have its ups and downs but what comes around, goes around.

The Magic Roundabout replaces several previous models which have suffered various problems over the years. A succession of unsuitable riders have been unseated from the one in Tottenham, leading to huge expenditure on imported spare parts of questionable quality. Similarly, the one in Leeds was found to be performing a downward spiral at an ever-increasing rate.

League Managers Association chief executive Richard Bevan expressed his support for the project. This is very exciting for our members, he said. The owners investment will Im sure bear untold riches and we should all be praising them to the Sky.</text>

<title>Man who shared money making secrets online shocked as competitors flood market</title>
<text>
Local man Ken Young was devastated last night after the bottom suddenly fell out of his work-from-home industry.

Young was earning around 700,000 a year, working from home with just his laptop, in some kind of unskilled position that needed no training. In an apparent act of philanthropy, or a misguided attempt at recruiting business partners, Young went online to tell millions of complete strangers his secret. Shortly after posting on multiple web sites The Home Working Secrets They Dont Want You To Know, Young suddenly found his fortunes took a nose dive. With barriers to entry low, suddenly millions of competitors flooded into the same market that Young had previously had all to himself.

It was a mistake anyone could make, says business analyst Gina Sharpe, author of Dont Tell Anyone My Secret Formula Will You, a business bible that is the talk of Wall Street and currently top of the New York Times best Sellers list. Which of us, on discovering a lucrative niche that nobody else is on, but which requires no great skill, could resist the temptation to share the news with all our competitors? says Sharpe. But Sharpe has some counter intuitive advice that top businessmen have known for years. If you give your secrets away, they aint valuable any more, says the tough talking broad. What does she mean by that? All will be explained in her follow up book: The Business Secret They Tried To Hush Up.

Experts are now questioning what made Ken Young make this terrible strategic mistake. I was onto such a good thing. I found a company that would pay me hundreds of thousands of pounds for a repetitive task that needed no great skill or effort. I suppose it went to my head and I thought I was untouchable, says Young.

He soon discovered how transient success can be. But he remains philosophical. He has a book coming out and Hugh Grant is set to play him in a heart-warming British comedy from Handmade Films. As one door closes another doors opens, and recently Ken Young was appointed to a top post that could see him pulling the levers of the economy. Hes going to be an advisor to Ed Balls.</text>

<title>Richard Scudamore challenges all women to an arm-wrestle</title>
<text>
With what is being seen as a vain attempt to garner support for his derogatory references to female irrationality, the Premier Leagues chief executive has promised to prove his genders superiority through a series of herculean tasks. The beleaguered football boss is said to have thrown down the gauntlet to all women to try and beat him at spitting, trapping spiders and weeing standing up.

Mr Scudamore insisted his comments were not sexist if you took into consideration his ability to parallel park, dominate the TV remote control and lift stuff. Football Association board member Heather Rabbatts accused the Premier League of having a closed culture of sexism but was forced to admit Scudamore was able to assemble flat pack furniture in a matter of minutes, recite the whole of Star Wars and burp for a full hour.

To a packed audience of female sports journalists, a spokesman for the Premier League slowly and loudly explained the offside rule and added: Of course women have a place in football. Many of our top footballers are married to women. If you asked the average fan who theyd prefer to pack their lunch, I know who theyd say.

The chief executive reeled off a list of his achievements, including less time wasted on phone conversations, packing and waxing. He then, in a commanding manner, deftly opened a jar of pickled eggs with one hand and then headed to the bathroom without the aid of a support group. His spokesman said: One day Im sure well see a woman playing in the Premiership on equal terms with a manjust for 20% less pay.</text>

<title>Dixons Carphone launch FannyCock range</title>
<text>
Already weary of dismal stand-up comedians and armchair satirists alike milking dicks on car phone jokes, the newly merged Dixons Carphone company has hit back by announcing their new signature range of in-car communications will be branded FannyCock.

Head of Marketing Theo Holtom proudly said, FannyCock is already a runaway success with pre-orders outstripping capacity, particularly in Thailand and Austria, oddly. We have been asked to bring out a range of phones and tablets for business users so jaded executives can say Ya Im on the FannyCock today, send me your spreadsheets and Ill look at them on that.

Archie Crump, a white van driver interviewed at Leicester Forest East confirmed The lads just cant envisage getting tired of saying, hang on, I am just about to enter the tunnel, you may lose me for a bit, or yeah Im on my FannyCock, youre breaking up.

Meanwhile police have confirmed that members of their traffic division are thoroughly looking forward to asking motorists is that a FannyCock you had in your hand just now sir?

The accompanying accessories range is also proving popular, according to the companys chief sales executive, Tim Wells. Putting a rubber FannyCock protector around an ordinary iPhone provides instant urban appeal, while children can afford to buy widgets to give as presents, just for the joy of saying its for your FannyCock gran. Phone gems and other bling provide an option to vajazzle your FannyCock. Truly the possibilities are endless. He broke off apologetically with Hang on, my FannyCock is vibrating, give me a moment

City analysts are confidently predicting that Dixons Carphone will be sitting pretty on their FannyCocks for some time to come.</text>

<title>Fire-damaged Glasgow School of Art wins Turner Prize</title>
<text>
Art lovers around the world were devasted when they heard most of the student works in the Glasgow School of Art had survived.

Miraculously, a large empty room, where an exhibition titled The History Of Scottish Art was being held, also remained completely untouched.

Tate supremo Sir Nicholas Serota urged authorities under no circumstances to restore the building and Charles Saatchi offered 60 million to save it for the nation in its current condition.

Unconfirmed speculation suggests the blaze could have been started as a revenge attack by the person whose rejected idea it was to demolish a few tower blocks at the opening ceremony of the upcoming Glasgow Commonwealth Games.</text>

<title>Morph under fire for stream of racist expletives</title>
<text>
Claymation character Morph, popularised by the childrens TV art show Take Hart, was today embroiled in a row over racism on the BBC.Though his words are commonly thought of as unintelligible babble, many are now accusing him of spewing an unbroken stream of racist expletives from the 1970s to the present.

The alleged plasticine racist was unavailable for comment, though issued this statement through his lawyer: I am shocked at the allegations. The thought that my language across 35-years has sounded like a constant tirade of racial abuse has left me confounded and bemused. I consider my views to be cosmopolitan and liberal; many of my closest friends are blue, nail brushes or made of tin foil.

Despite his outright denial at the accusations, Morph did concede that, when slowed down and amplified, there is one outtake scene of the popular 70s show where he may have been heard mumbling the word chalky to lighter-skinned co-star and friend, Chas, but insisted it was just friendly banter.

His statement continued: As amorphous characters made of modelling clay, we have a melting pot attitude to race, and I have for many years shared a pencil box with my life partner, Chas. Though we were no stranger to the kind of blue language that used to colour the air between takes in the Take Hart days, this was simply the culture of the time, and once the cameras were on everyone was purely professional.

The accusations come shortly after Top Gears Jeremy Clarkson received a ticking off from the BBC regarding his use of the popular nursery rhyme; Eeny, meeny, miny, moe. Officials who led the investigation have now confirmed that their next target will be the Teletubbies, after viewers became disturbed by worryingly ambiguous statements, such as; Icky noo noo, tiddly tiddly custard.

We have no idea what that means yet, but there must be some disgusting racial connotations in there somewhere, said one investigator.</text>

<title>Meat must be prepared away from salad and impaled on a large rotating spike, demand men</title>
<text>
Pub-going men up and down the country have stated clearly today that meat is only acceptable to eat if its basted in thick orangey grease, impaled on a large rotating metal spike, and is of questionable origin. Tensions have recently heightened across the UK after some men claimed that their local kebab shops simply havent been doing enough to accommodate their culinary requirements, and have felt the need to make clear definitions on how their meat should be prepared.

It must absolutely not come into contact with any salad whatsoever, explained one takeaway regular from Coventry. If a kebab shaving touches anything green, it effectively becomes inedible: You might as well just throw it on the pavement or leave it on your neighbours garden wall.

Many have also stressed the importance around which sauces can and cant accompany their meat trimmings and pita. Tony Edwards from Bath said: Garlic chilli sauce, providing its stored in a large unlabelled bottle and applied generously by a man from Turkey, is fine. However, taking the doner meat home and adding some dressing you bought in Waitrose simply wont do. Those who attempt this should be publicly punished in some way.

Kebab shop owner Mulayim Akbulut, who claims to have always respected and accommodated the culinary traditions of his local customers, said: I always prepare the kebabs in a way that makes my customers feel comfortable, including handling all food with no gloves and basting the elephant leg with the same brush I use to paint the walls. The customer is always right after all.

He added: Ive decided to go one step further for my customers and will ensure that all the meat I purchase comes from animals that have been killed in a very specific way . Once we discover what animal this is Ill get straight on it.</text>

<title>People who demand to be forgotten online cant remember why</title>
<text>
Google, Bing and the other search engine have been deluged with requests from people asking to remove details from their past that may appear when people put their name in a thingy. But many found they couldnt remember exactly what it was they wanted removed.

One man from Cheltenham whose name cant be used because weve forgotten it said; Better safe than sorry. If people put my name in Google or Crosby theyre sure to find out stuff that, frankly, Id rather not remember. So much so that I cant even remember it now. But thats not the point. I dont want to remember it, whatever it was, so best if I ask the internet search engine to remove all stuff that comes up that is linked to my name.

In contrast, one woman from Harlow said her memory was embarrassingly clear. Oh god, yes, every detail, she said. She told us exactly what it was, but unfortunately we omitted to write it down, although we do remember sniggering at the time. It may or may not have involved a baked potato.

Contacted later, the woman, who prefers to be anonymous said she couldnt remember supplying the details of the embarrassing and professionally damaging incident in her past. Its just as well because if you did remember you would have linked my name  Enid Smythurst  to the incident with the fire engine and the clown costume. You would have put it in your online edition and I would have had to demand that it be removed. Luckily that doesnt need to happen as you have appeared to have forgotten that the accident with the boomerang led to me receiving a 6 month suspended sentence and a ban from Colchesters Asda.</text>

<title>Duke and Duchess of Cambridge fail to mate, say keepers</title>
<text>
Scientists working at Kensington Palace have announced the mating window of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge has closed after the pair failed to conceive, despite several romantic encounters in a specially constructed royal love tunnel.

Efforts are continuing to encourage the shy, adorable pair to mate for what is thought to be the second time. In 2013 the female Kate-Kate gave birth to a single male offspring so impossibly cute that even its mother was sick for three months beforehand, but royal conservationists agree that this is not necessarily enough to guarantee the survival of the species Monarchia windsorica in the long term.

The couple had just 36 hours to procreate again before Kate-Kate became unreceptive, with the final meeting between the pair occurring last night, attended by both Professor Robert Winston and Peter Stringfellow. It had been expected that the two would have another attempt today, though tests revealed that the Duchesss hormone levels had dropped, leading to her watching The One Show and eating pizza while the heir to the throne read a book on polo. The couple have since been returned to their separate enclosures.

During the week they had shown signs of attraction to each other on several occasions, with Kate-Kate feigning interest in her husbands collection of African masks, and the couple were later spotted discussing charity work by press and tourists watching from a special viewing platform.

They showed encouraging signs, with the Duke appearing to mount the Duchess, a spokesman for the Palace told us, though it was later found that they had merely been wrestling over the TV remote.

Palace staff are already working with Russell Brand to construct a specially adapted kilt for the prince, in order for mating to proceed at just a few minutes notice if and when the opportunity arises.</text>

<title>Nothing found for 2011 05 06 Yes-to-form-coalition-with-no</title>

With what is being seen as a vain attempt to garner support for his derogatory references to female irrationality, the Premier Leagues chief executive has promised to prove his genders superiority through a series of herculean tasks. The beleaguered football boss is said to have thrown down the gauntlet to all women to try and beat him at spitting, trapping spiders and weeing standing up.

Already weary of dismal stand-up comedians and armchair satirists alike milking dicks on car phone jokes, the newly merged Dixons Carphone company has hit back by announcing their new signature range of in-car communications will be branded FannyCock.

Head of Marketing Theo Holtom proudly said, FannyCock is already a runaway success with pre-orders outstripping capacity, particularly in Thailand and Austria, oddly. We have been asked to bring out a range of phones and tablets for business users so jaded executives can say Ya Im on the FannyCock today, send me your spreadsheets and Ill look at them on that.

A baboon has resigned from UKIP following a fierce debate in the party over its future bananas policies.

Nigel  named after UKIPs charismatic leader  indicated he was leaving the party which, he alleged, has been taken over by a cartload of monkeys.

The resignation follows revelations that two chimpanzees and an orang-utan had left the party amidst claims they had been fiddling their fyffes expenses and following remarks by a UKIP councillor that orang-utans should go back to Pongo-Pongo land.

Google, Bing and the other search engine have been deluged with requests from people asking to remove details from their past that may appear when people put their name in a thingy. But many found they couldnt remember exactly what it was they wanted removed.

One man from Cheltenham whose name cant be used because weve forgotten it said; Better safe than sorry. If people put my name in Google or Crosby theyre sure to find out stuff that, frankly, Id rather not remember. So much so that I cant even remember it now. But thats not the point. I dont want to remember it, whatever it was, so best if I ask the internet search engine to remove all stuff that comes up that is linked to my name.</text>

<title>Anti-immigrant backlash feared as Irish pubs still emigrating in droves</title>
<text>
Supporters see them as a vital lubricant of the global labour market, while critics say they are diluting other cultures and putting local drinking dens out of business. Now there are calls for restrictions on the numbers of Irish pubs emigrating, yet the trend sees no signs of abating.

You have to go where the money is, to be sure, to be sure, said OMalleys, a brewery-themed hostelry that closed down in Dublin in 2011 and relocated to Ulaan Bataar, where he has established a thriving business among Mongolian hipsters who were previously unable to see live transmissions of Manchester United games while listening to jukeboxes playing the Pogues around the clock.

Meanwhile, The Golden Shamrock, which moved its retro Guinness ad posters, tinted pictures of James Joyce and cobbled floors from Cork to Vancouver last year, defended his move in terms of free market principles. About 300 of us are closing in Ireland every year, theres no demand for us at all at all. Here Im bringing work to all kinds of local industries  suppliers of stouts for those who dont like all this craft beer bollix, makers of aluminium horseshoes, you name it

The radically changed market in alcohol-fuelled mood alteration across the world is not all good news, however. In many countries, small bars are finding themselves out of work and occasionally turn on these brash incomers who import their culture of crisps and pretending to be Brendan Behan with no respect for local traditions.

In Japan last week, a marauding gang of izakaya assaulted a recent arrival, Donnellys, leaving him with three smashed stained-glass windows and in need of a stiff Jamesons. They were not mollified by stories that a few emigrant izakaya are prospering in Englands Home Counties, where small, extortionately expensive bars presided over by a stern mama-san has gone down well among former public schoolboys.

The whole thing is bad for those of us who stay in Ireland too, warned The Ship, a traditional Connemara pub. I used to be quite a sedate place, now even the locals seem to think that I should be just a venue for nightly sing-alongs to fiddle music. We are being lulled into participating in a pastiche of ersatz Oirishness foisted on us by the British that sees us as a pre-modern colonial other with a dissolute alcohol-centred identity that has nothing to do with the modern world. Drink. Feck. Arse. Girls.</text>

<title>Many to use May Day bank holiday to ponder utter futility of existence</title>
<text>
An increasing number of Britons are set to shun more traditional bank holiday pursuits this Monday in favour of contemplating the sheer pointlessness of their being, a study has revealed. Research carried out by the Institute of National Well-being has found that many British adults will forsake customary May Day activities such as a trip to the coast or spending time in the garden in favour of sitting at home staring into space and coming to terms with the fact that their lives are ultimately meaningless.

For some reason the May Day bank holiday leaves many people feeling bereft and empty, says Dr Jessica Harrington who headed up the research team. Possibly because it falls so soon after Easter but unlike Easter there is no spiritual or religious element. One lady, 53-year old Julia Winters of Canterbury, told researchers of her experience last May Day bank holiday: My husband got up early to play a round of golf with some friends and he seemed fine when he left the house, but when I opened the curtains an hour later he was sitting on the driveway clutching his golf bag and sobbing like a baby, he just kept saying whats the point? whats the bloody point? over and over again.

According to the study this type of incident is surprisingly common, as Dr Harrington explained: Many people told us that this year they would avoid the garden centre and the traffic jams in order to sit at home in their pyjamas contemplating the prospect of unavoidable annihilation and wrestling with the fact that their dreary little lives are ultimately futile, although many also said that if Live and Let Die came on they would probably watch it to cheer themselves up.</text>

<title>People who bought a house in the 1990s still smug, confirms survey</title>
<text>
All those who purchased a house in the late 1990s are still smug, according to a survey carried out by Halifax this week. The famous house price boom, which saw the value of many properties explode by 60% in a few short years, left many people in an enviable financial position, and most have now confirmed that they definitely knew exactly what they were doing.

Emma Stephens, whose husband Mike has carried a Filofax and worn red braces ever since he accidentally made a 30,000 profit on a bungalow in Epping, said: Its great to be cushioned with so much equity, but Mike has turned into such a huge twat since we bought in 1997. He went from being a really crap printer salesman to Donald Trump in the space of a week. I have to persuade him every year not to apply to be on The Apprentice.

The means by which we achieve victory are as important as the victory itself, explained Mike after reviewing his property value online for the seventh time this week. At the time it was a toss-up between a new house or a Ford Mondeo, but naturally I scented blood and went straight for the jugular.

He added: And as every other successful entrepreneur will agree, one must visualise victory before heading into battle, so I was quick to install a conservatory in 1999. Increased the value by a cool 2k, that did. To the victor, the spoils.</text>

<title>Yes to form coalition with No</title>
<text>
After the AV referendum count revealed no overall majority, Yes has announced the controversial step of forming a coalition with No, rather than their natural allies, Meh.

A defiant Yes, which came third behind No and Meh, sought to quell revolt among supporters, saying, Although many of our supporters might have preferred us to form a coalition with Meh, the fact of the matter is, Meh just shrugged and didnt want to enter serious talks with us.

Furthermore, the numbers just didnt add up. What would you rather us do? Surely its better to be in a position to form a stable coalition and have a chance to make a change than to stand on the sidelines or be a part of a ramshackle Maybe alliance of Meh, Huh?, Ill think about it and Whatever with no moral mandate

While many have pointed out that Yes and No are diametrically opposed on key issues, Yes reassured supporters that there was much common ground with No, and that this coalition would usher in a new era in consensual, compromise politics.

No, however, reminded Yes that the core policies of any No-Yes coalition would still of course be No but that Yes was welcome to piss away its credibility to allow No to take power, while Yes bore the brunt of the blame.

Asked if this would end uncertainty and provide a stable political base on which to build in the coming years, No said yes, Yes said Meh and Meh decided it was all too much, resigned, and got a high-level job in a huge multinational.

<title>Bedroom Tax may force Doctor Who to be evicted from TARDIS</title>
<text>
We have discovered a single man claiming housing benefit for a property that appears to have an infinite number of spare rooms, said Benefits Officer Kimberley Smalls. He is therefore liable for the most severe under-occupancy penalty.

The decision means the Doctor faces significant cuts to his housing benefit and he may be forced to leave the TARDIS and move to a one-bedroom flat in Neasden.

The spot check by housing benefit officers found that the Doctor has far more spare rooms in his 1960s police box than was previously thought. These include a sick bay, an observatory, a library, a secondary control room, several squash courts, an ancillary power station, a swimming pool and an attic.

This is quite simply a question of fairness, said government minister Esther McVey. It is totally unacceptable for a single man such as the Doctor to be living in a property with so many spare rooms  a property that could be used by a much larger family.

The Time Lord, who has been living in the Type 40 Mark 1 TARDIS for over 900 years, is appealing the decision on the grounds that his spare rooms only exist in extra dimensions of space and time that are not covered by the Welfare Act. However, legal experts say his chances of success are about as likely as a Cyberman winning The Voice by singing I Will Always Love You.

Housing benefit officers are also looking into allegations that the Doctor failed to declare periods of time when he was co-habiting with an assistant. He has a statutory duty to inform us of any changes to his circumstances, said Ms Smalls who is also investigating claims of identity fraud. Our records indicate the Doctor may have changed identities on at least twelve different occasions. He claims that he remains the same person; we shall see what the courts have to say about that.

If his appeal is rejected the Doctor may be evicted from the TARDIS as early as next month, which could seriously interfere with his work saving the planet from alien invasion. I had previously thought the Daleks were the most hate-fuelled creatures in the universe, unable to feel pity, remorse or compassion, said the Doctor, but even they wouldnt do this to me.</text>

<title>Facebook set to launch Babybook for hubristic parents</title>
<text>
In an attempt to stop the increasing number of users leaving the social network due to being continually bombarded with baby pictures and the related updates, Facebook is to launch an offshoot called Babybook.

The social network is receiving a large volume of complaints regarding friends or casual acquaintances constantly posting pictures with captions such as Babys first shit or Me at 4 cm dilated, you can almost see the head!!. In protest at this infantile inundation, many users are returning to Myspace and other social networks they cant quite remember.

It is hoped that Babybook will offer parents an outlet for their compulsion, and return others to a simpler time when they only had to pretend to look at 24 pictures of someones child, every now and then. Once their children reach a certain age and are no longer photogenic, Facebook anticipates that Babybookers will return to their main site. The new venture will see babies banned from Facebook, unless they are riding a cat, and the new social network will have strict controls as to how frequently pictures and updates can be added.

The launch of Babybook is being supported by the Child Protection Agency, who have recently voiced concerns about the amount of time new parents spend sharing their inconsequential thoughts and pictures. CPA spokesperson, Richie Gibbons said, Parents spend significantly more time looking at their children through a camera than with their actual eyes. As an experiment, all the pictures of one child from a randomly chosen Facebook account were printed off, and it was found that if you placed them together in a flipbook and flicked through, you could watch the child grow in real time.

According to the CPA, the trend is indicative of a failure among new parents to understand the basic principles of time and human development. New parents are continually plastering their Facebook walls with confused and trite comments in an attempt to make sense of it all. Common posts accompanying pictures include I cant believe she is three years old, where did the time go? and He is growing so fast, this time last year he was considerably smaller. This phenomena is baffling experts as the earth is still orbiting the Sun at the usual rate and aside from a few rapid growers, most children are developing at a normal rate.</text>

<title>Fit-For-Work tests to be conducted by killer robot</title>
<text>
Following the departure of Atos, the Department for Work and Pensions has awarded the contract for conducting Work Capability Assessments to Benefits Enforcement Droid model IDS-209.

The droid, manufactured by Omni Consumer Products, was originally intended for law enforcement and is armed with three auto cannons, one auto shotgun and a rocket launcher.

Yes, technically it is a killer robot, said DWP minister Esther McVey, but IDS-209 has been programmed to use its weapons in only the most extreme circumstances. So long as everyone complies with its requests there really shouldnt be any problems.

In future, applicants will be expected to sit before the droid, who will scan their benefits claim. If IDS-209 is in any way dissatisfied with the application, it will make the request: Please withdraw your claim. You have 20 seconds to comply. At this point, faced with an arsenal of lethal weaponry pointing directly at them, most claimants are expected to then drop their claim and go home.

However, critics of the scheme have pointed to early trials of the droid in which a number of applicants did as requested and withdrew their claims, but were then faced with the message: You have 10 seconds to comply, then, You have 5 seconds to comply, before IDS-209 opened fire and blew them out of the window.

Of course these incidents are regrettable, said Ms McVey, but if we ignore the human tragedy and look at it in purely monetary terms then this droid is already paying for itself.

The droids designer, Dr McNamara has admitted that IDS-209 does have some limitations. It has weak logic circuits and it cannot process information very quickly, he said. Also, it has no concept of compassion or human empathy, which is probably why it was awarded the contract in the first place.

IDS-209 will be rolled out from next month and will also be making house calls. It still has trouble getting through doorways, said Ms McVey, so for the time being it will be entering peoples homes by smashing through the outside wall and conducting its assessments amid the rubble. Needless to say, if anyone tries to run away it only goes to show they are fit for work.</text>

<title>Ecclestone announces Wacky shake up of Formula 1</title>
<text>
Formula 1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone has unveiled his full vision for this years racing season which builds upon his recent suggestion that drivers should be able to take shortcuts during a race. In a lengthy press statement he outlined the following proposals:

- Traction control to be outlawed, although cars will be allowed to have wings and take-off during a race.

 - Offensive weaponry to be permitted so that rival cars may be shot at, but only if a direct hit is non-lethal: merely rendering the car and its driver black faced and smoky.

 - Engine specifications to be relaxed so that Jet propulsion units may be fitted to vehicles.

 - Chassis modifications that enable a car to rise on stilts and pass over another car will now be acceptable to the FIA.

 - Vehicles may accommodate passengers ranging from dogs to whole families.

Under scrutiny from the assembled journalists Ecclestone admitted that his ideas may seem extreme but was quick to point out that the constructors had already signed up to the changes. Ferrari are developing a completely new car codenamed Arkansas Chugabug, McLarens new Mean Machine concept will be powered by an Acme sourced Jet Engine and Force India are adopting the Bouldermobile, a low-cost vehicle carved out of stone and powered by the legs of driver Adrian Sutil and new co-driver Captain Caveman.

The changes are taking place in celebration of the return of Michael Schumacher, or Dick Dastardly as hes known to other drivers.</text>

<title>Sky Atlantic debut gritty drama series about people who dont have Sky Atlantic</title>
<text>
An all new gritty drama series portraying the destitute people who dont have Sky Atlantic will be airing this Sunday at 9 PM.

Exclusive to Sky Atlantic, Game of Plebs season one chronicles the dark metamorphosis of Nigel Munnery, a well-meaning but flawed IT consultant from Stoke, who is being driven to insanity by colleagues talking about TV dramas not available on his Virgin Media television package.

After angrily spending night after night watching banal television series like MasterChef and The Michael McIntyre Chat Show, Munnery inevitably turns to a life of crime illegally downloading forbidden HBO television dramas. Here the lines between good and evil become distorted, and a maverick IT consultant is corrupted by Skys Dark Overlord Murdoch and his brutal reign over TV schedules.

Munnery is then submerged into the nihilistic underworld of illegal downloading. Our morally ambiguous anti-hero faces pop-ups from dodgy porn sites flashing up on the screen, as well as adverts about local girls in his area who want to sleep with him  an encounter met with suspicion considering he is an IT consultant from Stoke.

 As the story unfolds, minor grievances escalate into graphically violent scenes when an unrelenting blood-lust for compelling television leads him to [spoiler alert!] spilling tea all over his thighs  one of the many perils of trying to watch something on a laptop.

An exclusive promo of the series was also released containing pivotal scenes and epic quotes such as All men must die, If you want justice youve come to the wrong place, and the penultimate turning point of his transformation: Why the bloody hell am I paying for Channel 5!</text>

Venusian high command have recalled their latest human android for adjustment after it failed the eating normal food test. Following the successful integration of their Mekon Mark2 as Foreign Secretary and the replacement of the Prime Minister by a cardboard cutout with a microphone behind it saying We are listening to what the people say this is the first setback in their plan to take over the world.

At least they are not a bunch of swivel-eyed Eurosceptic loonies one BBC spokesperson said, Ok, underneath they are blue, their eyes swivel a bit, they have three mouths and a rather nasty stinger, but they really do believe in global warming as their home planet is 230 degrees in the shade and a world government so they must be one of us.</text>

<title>Cameron sparks outrage by posing for photos with dead politician</title>
<text>
Photographs of David Cameron posing with a dead politician have been condemned as heartless by family and friends of the deceased today. Some of the photographs clearly show Mr. Cameron laughing at the stricken body while others show him ignoring the lifeless corpse altogether.

The Prime Minister is reportedly seen regularly taunting the deceased, goading him with caustic remarks and cruel put-downs. In some of the photographs, the deceased looks helpless and confused, realising that his time is up. Some have claimed that in others, Cameron is clearly seen mocking the dead man, trampling over the corpse and using the remains as a convenient doormat.

The pictures were taken at various locations throughout the UK, including such unlikely locations as Downing Street, the Commons front bench and Government cabinet meetings. Id always wondered what the hell that dead guy was doing there, said one political correspondent. He was just always there, looking stiff and pointless, serving no purpose other than making Cameron look more energetic and interesting, which in itself is a tall order.

The first known picture of Cameron posing with the dead man appears to have been taken in a Westminster rose garden back in 2010. The controversial photographs continue to cause outrage throughout the UK although political commentators say proof of a legal death certificate and a detailed coroners report could help cool public anger.</text>

<title>Godzilla vs Romanian movie in the pipeline</title>
<text>
With a resurgence in fears of both Godzilla and Romanians, British filmmakers have discussed another possible reboot of the Godzilla movie franchise by pitting the Japanese monster against a Romanian immigrant.

British filmmaker Miles Cumbridge said he would take the amphibious reptilian monster known for destroying cities, and then pair him up against Godzilla in a thrilling blockbuster action movie. Theres nothing set in stone yet, said Cumbridge, but we envision a Romanian moving near Godzillas home somewhere along the Pacific Ocean, and just being up to no good in general. The audience is not quite sure what hes up to, but certainly not buying his nice neighbourly manner either!

Romanians are a new breed of destructive monsters, he explained. Theyre these blood-sucking, shape-shifting, moving-next-dooring creatures that inhabit the streets and are hell-bent on the destruction of middle-class neighbourhoods. They also have this supernatural power of being lazy benefit scroungers but at the same time manage to take jobs off hard-working Brits. So Godzilla will really have met his match in this particular film.

Cumbridge first made the comparison while hearing Romanians speaking in their native language on the bus, and believed it had a striking resemblance of the infamous Godzilla roar. At first I brushed this off as a mere coincidence. But then again, while having a quiet pint down the pub a Romanian working there walked by and caused a ripple in my lager, like the famous rippling water scene in Jurassic Park. It was then that I thought to myself: if someone doesnt make a monster movie out of this, I bloody well will!

Movies have already been made of Godzilla fighting other monsters such as King Kong, Zilla and The Sea Monster, but has never yet fought against something as frightening as an Eastern European armed with an EU passport. But being a giant radioactive lizard Godzilla will have an advantage against fighting a Romanian, Cumbridge added. The Romanian cant nick any of his money because he doesnt have any pockets.</text>
