<title>Nags to Riches: The syndicate owner racing to a 30,000% return</title>
<text>
(CNN) -- With owners ranging from onetime Presidents of the United States through Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Makhtoum to the Queen of England herself, horse racing is known as the 'Sport of Kings' for good reason.

If you're going to be a player, you're likely to need near-limitless funds.

Occasionally though, a relative pauper does manage to gatecrash the party every once in a while.

Take Dave Dillon, who works as a hotel controller in Chicago -- and who's absolutely convinced of one thing.

"I make no bones about the being the luckiest guy alive," he volunteered within seconds of speaking to CNN.

It's a big call that only seems more fanciful when you learn that Dillon, 59, has been granted a long-term medical leave of absence following surgery to treat prostate cancer.

Having bought into some 25-30 horses over the years, too many of which suffered from a case of the 'slows' -- as he laughingly puts it -- Dillon made a $5,000 transaction that would change his life.

Five years and $700,000 later, the expectation is that there's plenty more to come.

For when Dillon chose to buy 5% of a horse that nobody had wanted at a sales auction just weeks earlier, he bought a yearling that would not only win the most famous race in the United States -- the Kentucky Derby -- but also the world's richest race -- the $10m Dubai World Cup.

"When Animal Kingdom went through sales in 2009, no one bid on him so they brought him back and re-syndicated him. Team Valor -- the partnership that owned Animal Kingdom -- syndicated him for $100,000 and I bought 5%," Dillon expands.

"On the racetrack, he earned $8.8m."

The numbers are as extraordinary as Animal Kingdom's supreme career, which sparkled so brightly Dillon could well receive another $1m in stud fees.

In late 2012, 75% of Animal Kingdom was sold to an Australian stud farm called Arrowfield, which was chosen for its proven track record and because the deal allowed the horse's investors to remain involved.

Three months later, the champion horse won the Dubai World Cup -- with the success swiftly prompting Sheikh Mohammed, whose entry had been beaten by Animal Kingdom, to come on board.

His U.S.-based stud farm Darley bought a 29% stake in Animal Kingdom, with Arrowfield owning 51%, leaving Team Valor with the remaining 20%.

The figures are important because even though Dillon now owns just 1% of Animal Kingdom, this slender stake should still be enough to ensure a pampered retirement.

"There is no way you can explain how surreal this whole adventure has been, because we haven't made the real money yet," he said.

"His stud fee in Australia is $35,000 and he was recently mated to around 100 mares there.

"At the end of the southern hemisphere season, he was shuttled to Kentucky and is currently in the middle of his first season there.

"His American stud fee is $35,000 and it appears his Kentucky season will show him bred to 145 mares.

"So he'll generate between $7-9m in stud fees if he's successful but you won't know that until the first crop race. Then it could go up or down. But the fact he could generate $8-9m in fees for 10- to 15 years is the most amazing part for me."

Which means Dillon could make a return in excess of 30,000% on his investment.

"One of the rules of investing is finding the smartest guy in any industry and grabbing onto their coattails," said Dillon, explaining his decision to invest in Animal Kingdom.

"This success is all about Barry Irwin, the chairman of Team Valor, and I like to think the only smart thing I did was grab onto his coattails and hang on."

As with many racehorses, Animal Kingdom's ownership was shared among a syndicate or, as it's more commonly known in the U.S., a partnership.

The practice allows several investors to own a share of a horse for an affordable price, one that also enables them to feel like owners as they attend a race day.

The costs can vary greatly -- from as little as $140 in the United Kingdom to take part in an sizable syndicate of 100-odd investors to far heftier fees that start with a minimum investment of $42,000.

"There are various ways that people come into racing, and syndicates are a good way of testing the water," James Bethell, who runs the small Clarendon Thoroughbred Racing syndicate in northern England, told CNN.

"Investors don't have to make a great outlay, and they soon get a feel about whether they want to go any further."

Dillon says his good fortune was to invest with Team Valor but he's being modest, for he researched intensely before gambling on a man who also knew about leaps of faith.

In 1969, Team Valor chairman Irwin gave up a fiction writing career to work as a horseracing journalist and broadcaster -- a role he exploited to the full.

"I drove a lot of famous people nuts, asking them questions," he says on Team Valor's website. "But there were things I wanted to know and I was in a perfect place to pester racing's greats for answers."

Nine years in, he used his acquired knowledge to become a bloodstock agent before then switching to operating a stable of syndicated racehorses in 1987.

As a result of addressing conventional wisdom with a sledgehammer, Irwin's reward has been a glut of glittering trophies.

"What separates me from other people is that I only care about how the horses look and move -- namely, studying their athleticism and body," he told CNN.

"Most people are hung up on pedigree but when I started out, I didn't have that much money so that's why we adopted our strategy."

So Irwin relegated the importance of a horse's lineage (pedigree) below talent, athleticism, soundness and temperament, and the results have been spectacular.

Team Valor horses have won at least 25 Grade 1 races around the world, but Irwin feels Animal Kingdom defines his approach.

"He had a Brazilian sire, which nobody previously cared about, and a German mare. I went for it and bought both, did the mating and breeding, and thankfully it worked out," he said.

"When I buy a horse, I'm looking for a particular style that will be effective. And I'll tell you something I won't expand upon -- American racing is not about class, but about racing style and speed."

Despite the gains he has made by largely ignoring pedigree, Irwin says he doesn't see anyone copying his approach.

So it's ironic that Team Valor's contrary policy will be further rewarded as wannabe Grade 1 winners queue up to pay a small fortune for an Animal Kingdom foal.

All in the hope of sharing the parade rings and winners' enclosures with some of the world's most powerful people -- a holy grail Dillon is still wholly surprised to be part of.</text>

<title>Why can't Nigerians watch the country's biggest movie?</title>
<text>
Editor's note: Nigerian Biyi Bandele is the director of "Half of a Yellow Sun" (2013), a film based on a novel by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie about the Biafran war, in which over a million people died. The opinions expressed in this article are solely his.

(CNN) -- When I heard last month that the Nigerian Film and Video Censors Board, headquartered in Abuja, had indicated that it would be unable to issue certification for "Half of a Yellow Sun" in time for the film's release date, I naturally assumed, at first, that what we were faced with was nothing more sinister than another instance of the typical, if frustrating, culture of wilful incompetence that we'd grappled with during the making of the film -- while shooting the film in Nigeria two years ago, there were times when we felt ensnared in impenetrable jungles of red tape, when we would be given the go-head by one arm of the government only to find our path blocked by the other arm.

I had no reason to assume that there might be anything more to it than that. I had no reason to assume, for instance, that the inability of the board to issue the film with a certificate might actually be a clumsy, heavy-handed ban in all but name.

After all, when the movie had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival last autumn, amongst the entourage of Nigerians who flew in to Toronto for the occasion was Patricia Bala, director-general of the Nigerian censorship board.

Bala had arrived in Toronto -- I was told -- with several of her colleagues from the censor's office. I know for a fact that they watched the movie. I do not know for a fact that they all liked it. I cannot say if any one of them stood up when, as the end credits rolled, the audience rose and gave the film three standing ovations. But I do know that Bala was gracious enough to tell us after the screening how much she loved the movie. At no point did she express any reservations about the contents of the film.

It is now nearly eight months since Bala and her board first saw the movie in Toronto and a few weeks since she and her board have failed to issue "Half of a Yellow Sun" the certification that it needs -- that the law requires it obtains before it can be shown in cinemas in Nigeria.

In those several days I've been assailed -- on Twitter, Facebook, and by email -- with rumors, innuendos, half-truths, and downright lies, disseminated sometimes directly from the censorship board (they have issued at least one press statement), about why "Half of a Yellow Sun" still hasn't been issued with a ratings certificate.

The board claims that is has not banned the film but certain aspects of it "have some unresolved issues which have to be sorted out in accordance with the law and laid down regulations."

It has been rumored that FilmOne, the Nigerian distributors of "Half of a Yellow Sun," might have been late in submitting the film for certification. Not true. Most films that are screened in Nigerian cinemas are shown to the censor only a day or two before the films open to the paying public. In documentations that have been shown to me, there are instances even of movies being shown to the censor days after the movies had officially opened to the public. "Half of a Yellow Sun" was scheduled to open on April 25. It was submitted to the censorship board at least two weeks earlier.

I've also heard tell that the censorship board's inability to make a decision about a ratings certificate for my film has been brought upon it because of a sudden concern that a movie that depicts scenes from the Biafra war might provoke "tribal violence" in a country that has in recent months been besieged with terrorist bombings and profoundly shaken by the abduction of over 200 school girls by Boko Haram.

Since the Toronto premiere those many months ago, I've seen "Half of a Yellow Sun" at other film festivals in all corners of the globe. And Nigerians being the ubiquitous people that we are have been present in the audiences -- quite often in great numbers -- at each of these festivals.

I am yet to meet a single Nigerian who has seen the film who came out of the cinema thinking that they had just seen a film that would incite anyone to violence. If anything, more than once, I've been accosted by cinema-goers -- some Nigerian, but really, people of all races -- who have been profoundly moved by the experience of watching the film. The refrain I've heard from them is, war is nasty, isn't it.

Whether or not the film eventually gets a ratings certificate in Nigeria, "Half of a Yellow Sun" will be seen by millions of Nigerians. The question is: will they be allowed to see it in their local cinemas and on legally acquired DVDs or will they be forced to watch it on pirate DVDs and through illegal downloads? If the biggest film that's ever been made in Nigeria is available to Nigerians only in bootleg form, the censorship board will be doing to the Nigerian film industry what Boko Haram is trying to do to Nigeria: drive a stake through its heart. I sincerely hope they both fail.

<title>A bonny horse who loves to race  CNN World Sport</title>
<text>
All too often we see a favorite endlessly hyped up before a race only to disappoint on the bigday.

Well, that certainly was not the case in this years Kentucky Derby.

California Chrome, the flashy chestnut colt, was the focus of intense pre-race attention in the week leading up to the Derbynot only because of his impressive credentials but also because of his story.

Everybody loves an underdog and this bargain basement horse, in the purple and green DAP silks with a green bucking donkey motif on the back, belonged to two regular guys enjoying their first foray into the complex world of horse breeding.

Steve Coburn and Perry Martin each bought a share in a relatively inexpensive filly racehorse, Love The Chase, who won one race in six starts.

When the partnership decided to cut their losses and sell the sweet but slow filly, Coburn and Martin opted to buy out their partners for a value of $8,000 and send her to the breeding barn.

Selecting a stallion to cover your mare is often a labor intensive, almost mathematic process depending on what type of horse you are trying to produce.

For reasons best known to them, the pair settled on Lucky Pulpit for a fee of $2,000, himself an adequate racehorse who never fulfilled his maximum potential due to illness.

Eleven months later, out came the foal that would come to be named California Chrome - the name was pulled out of a hat of suggestions made by the owners and their families. Seabisquik was also in the mix.

When they sent the horse, now a three-year-old, to veteran trainer Art Sherman, the rookie owner-breeders told the ex-jockey that this would be his Kentucky Derby winner.

To cut a long story short, under the watchful care of his veteran trainer, this bonny horse who loves to race progressed so well that he wound up an unlikely favorite for the most famous race in the world.

And then he won it.

Going back to the colors worn by his Mexican jockey Victor Espinoza, the DAP stands for Dumb Ass Partnerships - so named by Coburn and Martin when those around them saidonly a "dumb ass" would buy California Chrome's mother Love The Chase.

While it's probably not the classiest name around, it does prove that for all the money and time spent on trying to breed the perfect racehorse, sometimes it's just down to luck.</text>

<title>Extreme IPO! GoPro plans $100 million offering</title>
<text>
The camera maker revealed plans Monday to raise $100 million in an initial public offering, as well as financial results showing several years of surging growth.

GoPro made its IPO plans known earlier this year but, because it filed confidentially, hasn't opened its books until now. The company's sales reached $986 million last year, more than four times its 2012 total, while profits hit $60.6 million, nearly doubling.

That pace has moderated a bit in 2014. GoPro recorded $236 million in sales for the first quarter, down from $255 million a year prior, while profits dropped to $11 million from $23 million in 2013.

The company plans to trade on the Nasdaq under the symbol "GPRO." That's a small victory for the exchange, which, despite its tech focus, has lost out to the New York Stock Exchange on offerings from companies like Twitter and Box.

GoPro rose to fame with its action cams -- small, weatherproof, mountable video cameras that offer excellent video quality and battery life considering their size. Thrill seeker Felix Baumgartner famously used a GoPro camera to record his free fall from space in 2012.

The cameras were initially marketed for extreme sports, but other hobbyists have been quick to find new uses for them. Drone enthusiasts, for example, have found the GoPro ideal for mounting on their flying vehicles and capturing footage from the skies.

But GoPro is also facing increased competition from some unlikely places. As companies like Google ( the Galaxy Gear watch, more people will be donning wearable cameras -- a market GoPro has largely cornered thus far.

Foxconn -- the Chinese manufacturer best known for assembling iPhones and iPads -- invested $200 million in the company in late 2012, giving it a 9% stake. At the time, the investment valued GoPro at about $2.25 billion.</text>

<title>Five things to know about Alibaba</title>
<text>
Alibaba was founded 15 years ago in the modest Hangzhou, China apartment of Jack Ma -- a former English teacher who started the company with an initial investment of $60,000 kicked in by 18 friends.

The company has since evolved into the dominant force in China's e-commerce industry, a market with so much potential that Alibaba's IPO may be the largest ever by a tech company -- surpassing even the record $16 billion raised by Facebook.

Here are five things to know about the tech giant:

Alibaba does more than just e-commerce: Alibaba is often described as a combination of Amazon ( Fortune 500) and eBay ( Fortune 500), with some PayPal sprinkled in to boot. But the shorthand fails to capture the breadth of the business model dreamed up by Ma.

By one estimate, almost four out of every five dollars spent online in China are spent in Alibaba's marketplaces.

The company's top two e-commerce sites, Taobao and Tmall, attract more than 100 million unique visitors each day. Estimates put the value of goods sold last year on the sites at $240 billion -- more than eBay and Amazon combined.

But Alibaba is more than its flagship marketplaces -- it also runs a wholesale operation and a cloud computing business. The company is also linked to a hugely popular digital payment service, Alipay. In a first step into finance, Alipay has started to offer investment funds. Alibaba even operates a taxi-hailing app.

Alibaba has a lock on China: Ever visited Taobao or Tmall? Go ahead and try. The first thing you'll notice is that the marketplaces have little in common with western e-commerce sites.

The website design is distinctly Chinese. Each page is crammed with products in an effort to mimic a crowded Chinese market. Buyers and sellers often use a built-in messaging service to chat with each other, and haggling over prices is standard.

Mastery of China's unique market has allowed the company to survive a series of challenges from companies including eBay, which bought Chinese auction competitor EachNet in 2003.

"I know the Chinese user market and users better than [former eBay CEO] Meg Whitman," Ma told the Wall Street Journal in 2005, as he stole market share from the American firm.

The IPO is going to be massive: The initial document filed with the SEC indicates that Alibaba plans to raise $1 billion, but that figure is seen as just a placeholder. Analysts have said it could haul in more than the $16 billion Facebook raised in 2012.

That's really big -- and if it increases further, Alibaba could be a contender for the largest IPO in U.S. history.

Analysts think the whole company could be worth more than $170 billion, and some sky-high estimates are now pushing $200 billion.

Founder Jack Ma is one very rich former English teacher: One of Alibaba's biggest assets is Ma, who has stepped down as CEO but remains chairman of the company. He's known in China as a charismatic leader with a reputation for bold ideas.

Before founding Alibaba, Ma was twice rejected from a teaching college and was even turned away by a local KFC restaurant.

Ma is ranked China's 29th richest man with a net worth of over $4 billion, according to the Hurun Rich List, which tracks wealth in the country. The IPO should boost his bank account.

Alibaba has challenges, too: For all the plaudits, Alibaba is not without blemish. Of particular concern are the number of counterfeit goods sold in its marketplaces, and the company's commitment to sound corporate governance.

Hong Kong is the preferred destination for many of China's top companies seeking to go public, but Alibaba chose to list in New York after Hong Kong regulators refused to allow the company's partners to appoint board members.

The company's SEC filing lists only three directors that will remain as the company begins final IPO preparations: Ma, Alibaba CEO Joe Tsai and Softbank (

Alibaba -- like all tech companies -- must also work to adapt as consumers abandon desktop computing and shift to mobile devices.

In addition, the company must effectively manage relations with the Chinese government, which has not developed clear regulations for some services offered by Alibaba.</text>

For more Last Look, watch GPS, Sundays at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. ET on CNN



Here at GPS, we love deep data dives. We also revel in the fact that America continues to be the melting pot that it has always been. So we were interested to see a piece on Slate.com last week analyzing the most common languages spoken in each state using U.S. census data.

This first map is predictable  other than English, Spanish is the most spoken language in almost all U.S. states. But watch what happens when you remove Spanish from the equation. Now there is the melting pot.

In Michigan, Arabic clocks in as the third most commonly spoken language.

It's Vietnamese in four states  Texas, Oklahoma, Nebraska and Washington.

It's a Filipino language called Tagalog in Hawaii, California, and Nevada.

In four states, its Native American languages.

And in 16 states, it's German. If you're surprised at that number, according to recent census measures of countries of ancestry, people of German heritage outnumber all other groups in the United States  even Irish! Remember, until World War I, by some accounts, German was the second most widely spoken language in all of the United States. And that tradition seems to linger.</text>

<title>Cousin tells of Filipino maid's horrific burns</title>
<text>
(CNN) -- The man who shared images of the abuse that a Filipino maid allegedly suffered on the job in Saudi Arabia said he did so because he didn't know what else to do.

Arnel Tahal is a cousin of the victim, Pahima Alagai Palacasi, and was shown the graphic photos of burns all over Palacasi's back, arms and legs by another cousin.

Tahal said he posted the pictures on Facebook because "I did not know what to do. But after people started sharing the pictures, some told us what we can do to help her."

The result is that the injured Palacasi, who is married and has two young children, will remain in Riyadh in a search for justice.

The burns allegedly came at the hands of her employer's mother.

The 22-year-old maid was at the home of her employer's mother on May 4 when "her sponsor's mother poured boiled water over Palacasi due to a simple misunderstanding," according to a Philippines Labor Ministry statement posted Tuesday.

Tahal told CNN that the employer's mother poured a thermos of scalding water on the maid after yelling at her for not preparing coffee quick enough.

Two days later, the employer took Palacasi for medical care.

While at hospital, Palacasi was able to reach a relative who lives in Riyadh who helped her sneak out of hospital. The cousin then posted graphic photos of Palacasi's wounds on Facebook, showing bright pink and white scalded skin all over her back, the backs of her arms, and parts of her leg, according to the ministry statement.

"I feel that we need more help from the government of the Philippines to get justice for my cousin," Tahal said.

The Philippines government said it would help Palacasi file a case against her employer and has suspended the work of the Saudi recruitment agency that hired her.

The English-language Saudi daily Arab News reported Wednesday that Riyadh police were conducting a joint investigation of the case.

Palacasi alleges that her employer began physically abusing her within days of her arrival, kicking and lashing her after she complained of being homesick. She also claimed her employers deprived her of food.

"[My employer's mother] asked me to throw away all the leftover food but I didn't do it so that when I got hungry I could have something to eat," Palacasi said in a cellphone video reportedly taken by her cousin and released to ABS-CBN, a CNN affiliate in the Philippines.

CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the video.

"Please help me," Palacasi says in the video. "Help me file a case against my employer. I suffered a lot."

Palacasi is currently at an embassy shelter in Riyadh. "She is stable, in high spirits, and is relating well with fellow (Filipino workers)," according to the government statement.

"We are following up on the case with the police and the embassy and we will respond once we have all the details of the case," Mohammed Almadi of Saudi Arabia's Human Rights Commission told CNN.</text>

<title>Autism success stories: Learning to talk at 9 years old</title>
<text>
Editor's note: April is National Autism Awareness Month. Journalist Ron Suskind's emotional essay in The New York Times Magazine about reaching his son using dialogue from scenes in Disney movies inspired CNN iReport to ask families for their communication strategies.

(CNN) -- Bobby Smith's mother, like all parents, looked forward to the day when her baby could use words to tell her what was wrong. What hurts? Why are you sad?

By the time Bobby turned 7, Cheri Smith was still wondering if that day would ever come.

Her son had been diagnosed on the moderate-to-severe end of the autism spectrum as a toddler. He had ways of conveying his needs -- he'd give Smith or her husband the remote control if he wanted to watch TV, or hand his mom her purse if he wanted to go out -- but there were so many things he couldn't communicate.

He "cannot tell us if something hurts, why he is upset or happy, where he would like to go, what happened at school today, what he would like to do for his birthday, what he would like Santa to bring him for Christmas," Smith wrote on CNN iReport in March 2012. The older he grew, the worse Bobby's behavior was getting. He would fly into rages, which Smith believed were in part the result of his inability to effectively communicate his feelings and to understand what others were telling him.

Desperate for help, in April 2012, Smith found a behavioral therapist who would change their family's life. Bobby turns 10 next month and is a totally different boy now, she said.

"She knew that Bobby had the ability to talk," Smith said in a recent update. "She pushed Bobby like none of us had before."

Wherever they fall on the spectrum, people with autism often struggle with communication. They can have trouble developing language skills or fail to understand nonverbal communication through things like eye contact and facial expressions.

Parents, therapists and those with autism themselves described a gamut of communication techniques that have helped. Besides working on actual talking, some have found success with picture card systems, sign language or printed words; others speak through stuffed animals or video game characters.

Kat Muir, 26, works as a speech-language pathologist in Indianapolis, bridging the communication gap. Most of the children she works with have Autism Spectrum Disorder -- like herself. Muir was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome at age 22 when she was in graduate school and still not making friends.

She was always adept at using words, but was challenged by social communication. It was particularly hard in junior high.

"Girls are expected to know instinctively how to be social, and when they don't, it is very obvious," she said.

For years, she thought of a conversation "as a contest to see who could say the most interesting thing." She remembers one time when some girls were talking about Britney Spears; she jumped in with her own contribution, saying something like, "Planes in World War I had synchronized guns so the gunmen didn't shoot their own propellers off."

No one cared. And they told her so.

It got better when she moved to a big public high school, where students seemed more tolerant of differences. Now she reminds herself to talk about what other people like, not just what she finds interesting.

She said it helps to find an activity "that encourages communication but doesn't force it." For her, that's dance class.

"It's reassuring to know that I will see familiar faces for an hour at the same time every week. I may socialize by starting a conversation about favorite dance moves, or I may exchange smiles with someone because we're doing what we love. The more structured a social interaction is, the more comfortable it is."

To those without autism, said Muir, "Everyone with autism has something to say. Learn to speak our language, and we will learn to speak yours."

California speech-language pathologist Lois Jean Brady agrees. As a certified autism specialist, she advises parents to use their child's special interests -- animals, music, technology or cars, for instance -- to build their language.

"Go into their world and slowly lead them to yours," she said.

With students who love animals, Brady uses a potbellied pig named Buttercup to communicate. She has found many children feel comfortable talking with an animal and some have said their first words to Buttercup.

She tells the story of a junior high school student who desperately wanted friends. She rehearsed a few answers to "common pig questions" such as "What does he eat?" and "How much does he weigh?" then sent the young man into the school hallway with Buttercup on a leash.

"It was not long before he was surrounded by other students, mostly girls, answering questions with a smile from ear to ear. A couple of the students remained friends," she said.

Brady's own son is on the autism spectrum. He is now 20 years old, goes to college and works with other special needs children. When he was younger, he and his mother would spend hours in the living room, lining up toy cars.

"I kept the cars in a large bucket and if he wanted one he had to ask for it," Brady said. "Initially it was just 'car,' then 'blue car,' then 'shiny blue car,' building language one car at a time."

It has taken about two years for Emily Ferguson's son Sammy to learn to use cards with pictures to communicate. The 8-year-old has severe autism, and speaks about three to seven words a month. He can't tell his mother when he's in pain, and she would give anything to have a conversation with him. But she celebrates that he is able to communicate about 30 food requests and 16 nonfood requests (play, go outside, etc.) through pictures.

"I was tickled when Sammy realized he had no limit to the amount of times he could request cookies. For the first time, I felt like a 'normal' mother, because I had a child who was asking for something he wanted repeatedly, and he was getting the same answer ('No.')," Ferguson wrote in an e-mail.

"It has been an amazing experience to see Sammy go from just crying to using pointing to giving others picture cards on sentence strips."

Ferguson prays Sammy will find the communication tools that work best for him, "and that he will be able to share his thoughts and emotions with those around him. Until that day, I want the world to understand that my child is worth respecting, loving and cherishing."

Cheri Smith's son, Bobby, knew about 50 words by the time he was 9, but his main form of communication was taking his parents by the hand to what he wanted. A behavioral therapist near their West Virginia home helped Smith understand that their son was physically capable of speaking more, with practice.

For the first six months, therapist Sharon Holbert worked with Bobby on sitting properly in his seat, keeping his hands folded on the table (instead of hitting her) and his feet in front of him (instead of kicking her). There was a close link between behavior and talking: As he learned how to stay calm, he was able to learn more; as he became better at communicating, he grew more relaxed, Holbert said.

"If you have a student who's hitting and screaming and kicking, you can't teach them anything. Once you get them to a place where they're ready to learn, then bam, you can do something," said Holbert, a board-certified behavior analyst. "His ability to learn was there. I think he figured out 'if I hit people, they probably will leave me alone.'"

As they worked on identifying colors, numbers or letters, Holbert wouldn't acknowledge his response as correct unless he said it verbally.

"If he wanted any food items, if he wanted a particular TV show that he liked, if he wanted to go outside, he had to ask verbally or he didn't get his want," Smith said. "Quickly it was just easier for him to say the word than it was to throw a fit."

He can now verbally identify letters, colors, animals and some shapes, count up to 20 and say about 100 vocabulary words. He can answer simple questions and has gone from using single words to short sentences like, "I want rice cakes please," or mostly complete sentences like, "I want swim at the beach."

"We went from being a family where our child was physically aggressive and having constant meltdowns to one that is enjoying experiencing the world through Bobby's eyes."

He also has his own unique language, which his parents have come to appreciate, too.

Bobby loves to go for car rides. When he wants his mom to turn down a particular road, "he will put on his own turn signal. He clicks his tongue and makes it sound exactly like a car's turn signal, and that is how I have known where he wants to go."</text>

<title>Egyptians vote in presidential election</title>
<text>
Editor's note: For full coverage of the Egyptian election in Arabic, visit CNN Arabic.

(CNN) -- The first day of voting in Egypt's presidential election was relatively quiet, state media reported Monday, though one man connected to a campaign was shot to death.

Polls will reopen at 9 a.m. Tuesday for the last day of voting. Egyptians are choosing between two candidates: Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Hamdeen Sabahy.

Egyptian Prime Minister Ibrahim Mehleb declared Tuesday a public holiday "in compliance to citizens' wishes," state TV reported. The decision is thought to be a move to increase turnout.

Public service ads, media campaigns and the electoral ads of the el-Sisi campaign stressed that voting is a patriotic duty.

The election was called because Mohamed Morsy, Egypt's first freely elected president, was removed from power in July in a popular military coup.

A man working for el-Sisi's campaign was fatally shot near Cairo on Monday, Interior Ministry spokesman Alaa Mahmoud said.

Mohamed Fathy, 35, was getting out of a taxi in the village of Kerdassa on the western edge of Cairo when he was shot in the head by unknown gunmen, Mahmoud said.

Fathy was active in the el-Sisi presidential campaign and was a member of the Tamarod political movement, according to a statement from Tamarod.

Police are investigating, but Assistant Interior Minister for Information Abdel-Fattah Othman has said the slaying has nothing to do with the election process.

Tamarod has blamed the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood group, which had held a small protest in Kerdassa earlier in the day.

Abdul Mawgoud Dardery, a spokesman for the Muslim Brotherhood, criticized the election: "What you have in Egypt now is not democracy but a militacracy. ... What we have now is Mubarak coming back. Sisi is Mubarak version 2014, and that is the tragedy."

Mahmoud also said a bomb was detected and defused at the Ahmed Sayed I school polling station in Giza.

Egypt's state-run news agency MENA reported clashes in a polling station at Umraniya district but said they didn't disrupt the vote.

Beni Suef Security Director Ibrahim Hadib said that seven members of the Muslim Brotherhood were arrested for trying to disrupt the electoral process in that town, MENA reported.

A number of people hurled Molotov cocktails at the headquarters of el-Sisi's campaign in the town of Hosh Issa. No material damage or casualties were reported, MENA said.

"The day has sadly witnessed many violations observed, documented and announced by the campaign, led by banning Sabahy delegates from entering polling centers, collective voting, physical assaults against delegates and lawyers, let alone some cases of intervention by police and army forces," it said in a statement.

"The campaign hopes that these violations would not repeat tomorrow."

<title>Opinion: Will Ukraine's 'Candy Man' deliver the goods?</title>
<text>
Editor's note: Alexander Nekrassov is a Russian commentator and former Russian presidential and government adviser. The views expressed in this commentary are his own.

(CNN) -- The thing about presidential elections, be it in Ukraine or anywhere else for that matter, is that it makes sense to ignore everything that was said during the election campaign and, especially, in the immediate aftermath.

Election promises are made to be broken or ignored altogether -- remember "Yes We Can?" And in the first few days, or even weeks, after results are announced lots of things are said that mean pretty much nothing.

To say that the presidential election campaign in Ukraine produced a lot of statements and pledges that made little or no sense would be an understatement. If you summarise them all, then Ukraine should be in fine shape to join the G7 group of industrialised nations, replacing Russia, in about five years' time.

The election winner, confectionary billionaire Petro Poroshenko, and his nearest rival, former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko - the two have received 57 and 12 per cent of the votes respectively - have promised to unite Ukraine, suppress the rebellion in the east, return Crimea grabbed by Russia, revive the country and put it smack at the heart of Europe while practically no-one even bothered to contradict them. And even Darth Vader -- one of 17 candidates for the presidency, walking around in full Star Wars costume -- didn't really sound over the top compared to others.</text>

<title>The smog-guzzling buildings fighting deadly pollution</title>
<text>
Vital Signs is a monthly program bringing viewers health stories from around the world.

(CNN) -- Air pollution is now the biggest global environmental killer, the WHO has confirmed. The seven million deaths it caused in 2012 exceeded the victims of cigarettes, and is more than double previous estimates.

Air pollution in over half of 1,600 cities surveyed is now above safe limits of Particulate Matter (PM), with the highest cost borne by the poorer regions of South-East Asia and the Western Pacific.

In Delhi, found to have the worst pollution in the world, around 10,000 people die prematurely each year because of pollution. Most of these perish through strokes, heart conditions, and cancer, and the issues are multiplying.

"We are now seeing a large number of lung impairments and respiratory problems among children," says Anumita Roy Chowdhury, head of the Clean Air Program at India's Center for Science and Environment. "There is a strong correlation with emergency hospitalizations in winter when the pollution is high."

Read this: Top 20 most polluted cities in the world

But although there is widespread agreement that restricting emissions is an effective solution, badly affected cities are increasingly turning to technological solutions. The Manuel Gea Gonzlez Hospital in Mexico City unveiled a "smog-eating" facade last year, covering 2,500 square meters with a titanium dioxide coating that reacts with light to neutralize elements of air pollution. Designers claim it negates the effects of 1,000 cars each day.

An even grander project, the Palazzo Italia, will use similar materials over 13,000 square meters across six floors when it opens in Milan in 2015. Dutch scientists have also adapted the system to roads, claiming this can reduce pollution by 45%.

The material is not prohibitively expensive -- adding as little as 4-5% to construction costs. But the impact of such buildings has been limited to their immediate location, and efforts to develop the concept have led to more novel, personalized solutions.

The first pollution-eating poem appeared this May in Sheffield, England, a 20-meter banner of Simon Armitage's "In Praise of Air," coated with titanium dioxide nano-particles that can counteract around 20 cars' worth of pollution each day. While it is a creative tool for promoting a local poetry festival, it also serves as proof of concept that the technology can be incorporated into practically any textile, and will be reproduced on several more banners and posters in the coming months.

But the ultimate goal is to render us all air-purifying units. The poem is an offshoot of Catalytic Clothing, a collaboration between designer Helen Storey and polymer chemist Tony Ryan that aims to incorporate titanium dioxide nano-particles into laundry detergent, so that our outfits are coated.

"Clothes are the way to do it because they are ubiquitous," says Ryan. "In the city of Sheffield we need to get rid of 1,000 tons of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) each year to comply with air quality regulations, which is around three tons per day."

The concept relies on mass participation. Ryan says that one person wearing clothes washed in the detergent could remove 5-6 grams of NO2 from the air every day -- which means Sheffield's population of just over half a million could collectively enable the city to meet its NO2 target.

One drawback is that the laundered material would not distinguish between atmospheric impurities, so that expensive perfume would be neutralized as well as smog, which has been an issue for manufacturers. There have also been suggestions that the particles could be an irritant, although Ryan -- who has been testing the product on himself -- denies this.

A more immediate, easier option is becoming available through a personal pollution monitor. The MicroPEM sensor developed by the Research Triangle Institute (RTI) picks up a range of exposure data to help the user manage risk.

Early trials have focused on detecting indoor pollution from cook stoves in the developing world, which account for over two million deaths per year through exposure to toxic smoke, most commonly through respiratory diseases. But the device could be applied to a wide range of environments, to indicate a wide range of health threats.

"For many diseases we haven't determined whether one component (of pollution) is more causal than another," says lead developer and RTI environmental exposure expert Dr. Charles Rodes. "But this can measure for diseases with rapid responses like asthma or pulmonary disease where it doesn't have to be specific, we just measure total exposure to particles of a certain size (PM)." In the case of asthma, among the most common pollution-related conditions, an attack can follow soon after exposure, and early warning can save lives.

Rodes believes a personalized approach to monitoring can reach the people most vulnerable to air pollution better than stationary systems. "It's the intersection between the most exposed and the most susceptible that tells you most about the environmental threat -- and personal level measurement is about the only way to find out."

The scientist is confident that the technology is moving from the lab environment toward public availability, following trials at academic institutions in the United States, United Kingdom and China. The units currently cost around $2,000 but will come down with demand, although there may be trade-offs to make it accessible. "If you want something that's easy to use it tends not to be as accurate or specific," says Rodes.

Nonetheless, its makers claim the MicroPEM will be the most sophisticated mobile pollution measurement tool available. While smartphone apps are proliferating, their functions are basic.

Biomimicry could also provide a meaningful sensor. Zoologist Dr. Fritz Vollrath of the University of Oxford has worked with spiders to draw inspiration from their materials and methods, and believes the sensitivity of their webs is unsurpassed.

"The thinness and electrical charge of the fibers allows them to catch any particles flying through the air, and the liquid coating is like a glue (that binds them)," says Vollrath. The web is sensitive enough to capture "individual spores and atoms."

Vollrath believes a synthesized silk web would be a perfect tool for capture and measurement of pollutants, to reveal the extent of danger in the atmosphere. This could be tested by a chemical probe to provide a detailed breakdown of what has been caught. He envisages such a web could be used anywhere from disaster zones to hospitals and homes -- "a mesh near the source of pollution -- such as over the chimney." His concepts are already being realized.

Crowdsourcing and citizen science are also offering solutions. Chinese innovators launched the FLOAT project that gave concerned citizens the chance to take air quality readings using pollution-sensing kites, and then submit the results to a database for findings to be shared. Similar citizen alliances are taking to the skies from London to Philadelphia.

For all the futuristic possibilities, this may be the most effective action citizens can take. "Putting data out means more accountability," says Dr. Carlos Dora, Coordinator of Interventions for Healthy Environment at the WHO, pointing out that governments can reverse the effects of pollution if they are committed -- such as in Berlin, where private cars have been restricted in some areas, or Beijing, where factories scaled down for the 2008 Olympics, triggering a marked improvement in air quality.

The full truth, with the pressure that brings to bear on authorities that are still empowered to effect change, could yet reverse the deadly plague of pollution.

<title>That is a lie  Marine Le Pen disputes reports of Fathers comments  Amanpour</title>
<text>
Marine Le Pen, leader of Frances far-right National Front party, disputed on Friday reports that her father suggested Ebola as a possible cure for Europes immigration problem.

Madame, this is a lie, Le Pen told CNNs Christiane Amanpour. That is a lie, a maneuver, a campaign maneuver. He never said that.

Ahead of European Parliament elections, Jean-Marie Le Pen  founder of the National Front  reportedly said the deadly Ebola virus could help step global population and help Europes immigration problem in the process, according to French media.

He was not speaking about immigration, Marine Le Pen said. He was speaking about the fate of humanity as a whole. That is what he said.

The National Front, like many far-right parties across Europe, is grappling with allegations that in advocating more national autonomy from the EU they are also spewing racist propaganda.

I do not have any image to clean up as far as the leadership is concerned. [My father] defends all French people, whatever their race, whatever their religion, whatever their origins.

So let me just be clear, Amanpour said, the French press reported that those were your fathers words ahead of a rally in Marseille this week on Tuesday. Are you denying that?

Yes, it is a lie, Le Pen said.</text>

<title>Narendra Modi appointed as India's prime minister</title>
<text>
New Delhi (CNN) -- India's president appointed Narendra Modi as the new prime minister of the world's largest democracy Tuesday, the presidential palace said in a statement.

Modi succeeds Manmohan Singh, whose Congress party suffered its worst-ever defeat in the recent general elections.

President Pranab Mukherjee will administer the oath of office and secrecy to Modi on May 26, the statement said.

Earlier in the day, Modi made his maiden visit to the national parliament as a federal lawmaker. In a traditional gesture of supplication to what Indians call their temple of democracy, he bowed down on the first step of the building's entry stairs.

After he was officially named leader of his Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) parliamentary group, Modi made a passionate speech in Hindi.

In his televised address to BJP lawmakers, he broke down briefly as he hailed both the nation and his party as his "mother."

"I have done no favor. Can serving the mother be called a favor?" he asked, pausing to sip water. "India is my mother and so is the BJP. You do no favor to your mother. You only serve her," he said, his voice choked with emotion.

Modi vowed to increase efforts to eradicate poverty, create employment opportunities for the country's young workers and provide a safer environment for women.

The BJP has swept the five-phase national elections that concluded on May 12, winning 282 of the 543 seats of the parliament's lower house on its own in what has been a historic mandate for any single party in decades in India.

Together, the BJP-led coalition -- called the National Democratic Alliance -- comprises 335 elected members in the lower chamber called the Lok Sabha, or the House of People.

<title>Sailing a lifesaver for record-breaking yachtswoman Hilary Lister</title>
<text>
(CNN) -- Hilary Lister had had the difficult conversation with her husband -- a few times in fact. The quadriplegic had finally made the decision to end her life, had prepared to say goodbyes to Clifford and the rest of her family.

"It got to a point where I evaluated my life," Lister told CNN. "I had to decide whether the space that I take up on the sofa [which unable to move she had done for hours and days on end] was still worth inhabiting.

"I came to the conclusion it wasn't. I was at a very, very low point.

"I knew if and when my condition got any worse I would end my life. That was a decision myself and my husband were both aware of. You don't make that decision on your own, you have to prepare yourself."

It was to be a pre-ordained death with rules.

"Basically, I wouldn't allow myself to take my tablets any more if I got much worse or got depressed or whatever," Lister added.

"But I also set parameters to make sure that it wasn't a spur of the moment thing. I have wonderful friends and family, who made sure they did everything to make sure my life was worth living."

For all their collective positivity, though, nothing worked, until a friend lured Lister to an outing on the water at Westbere Sailing Club, her local club in southern England.

"It wouldn't overstate it to say that sailing saved my life," said Lister.

"It just gave me a little glimmer of thinking that space I was taking up on the sofa was worth inhabiting after all, particularly as someone had managed to get me off it to get on the water.

"It was like 'gosh, I've found a reason to live.'"

Since that Damascene conversion she has sailed single handed across the English Channel, circumnavigated Great Britain and most recently sailed the 1,500 kilometers across the Arabian Sea from Mumbai to Muscat, her first proper offshore expedition.

It made her the first paralyzed women to complete the voyage while also on board was Omani yachtswoman Nashwa Al Kindi, the first Arab woman to complete the trip.

Lister suffers from reflex sympathetic dystrophy, a muscle wasting disease caused by a genetic blip that now prevents her from using her arms and legs.

With her sole movement in her head, Lister's boat for that voyage -- a 28-ft Dragonfly trimaran -- was rigged up for her to sail it using innovative methods originally designed in the United States.

"I have three straws with which you register positive or negative pressure - so puff or suck," she explains.

"That turns the winch one way or the other. The magic thing on the latest trip is that I was able to turn port and starboard in opposite directions at the same time thanks to reversible winches and thus fully tack the boat rather than doing it slowly, slowly bit by bit."

The 41-year-old hasn't always lacked mobility and it wasn't until the age of 11 that she noticed there might be something awry.

"I came off the hockey pitch with really sore knees," she recalls. "I thought it was growing pains and would go away. By 13, it was hurting walking up and down stairs but again I thought it would go away."

It didn't. By the age of 17, she had lost the use of her legs, though she refused to give up on her ambition to become a biochemist -- an ambition she says she had from the age of three, which she achieved with a university degree followed by a PhD.

Working in a lab on her PhD she had to concentrate on not dropping things.

One day, though, three months of work and 12,000 worth of samples slipped out of her hands.

She never returned to the lab and a complex operation, which involved blood drained from her arms with an injection to stun painful nerve ends, did not work.

"Life isn't always straightforward," reflects Lister. "You just have to be grateful for what you have when you have it."

For her, that is out on the water.

"It's such a liberating place, it's where you feel free. Once on the boat I can sail it as well as anyone really. I can forget about work or home life, anything in fact.

"You just think about the next wave and the next puff of wind coming. The wheelchair's not there, I'm a sailor and it's a huge feeling of freedom.

"But it's more than that. It's there that the pain dissipates. It doesn't entirely go away, when you smack a wave, wow, I feel it. But it's like an itch, if there's something else, you forget about it."

Despite her lack of movement, Lister still suffers from crippling pain thought to be caused by one particular fully functioning problematic nerve that sends a feeling of immense pain, heat or cold coursing through her veins.

It's something that has to be treated with a daily diet of opiates and morphine, though the pain never properly vanishes.

It does not, however, stop her from planning new expeditions. There is one dream trip for Lister, who is sponsored by GAC Pindar, that hangs above all others.

"I want a longer crossing and I'm looking at something for next year.

"The dream would be to sail across the Atlantic -- it's something I've been thinking about and looking into for a long time. But we're quite a way off from getting to that point.

"People talk about the dangers but I have a safety boat with me in case I capsize. There are dangers certainly but it's about risk management. There are more people hurt riding horses each year than sailing."

It is such dreams that give Lister hope as she sits back on her sofa thinking of a myriad of oceans still to explore.

<title>Scientific institute lists the top 10 newly discovered species</title>
<text>
(CNN) -- Consider it the taxonomist's equivalent of a People magazine's Most Beautiful List.

An international committee made up of scientists and related experts has announced its top 10 of nearly 18,000 new species named in the previous year, according to a news release from the International Institute for Species Exploration, part of the State University of New York's College of Environmental Science and Forestry.

The alphabetical list was launched in 2008 and is released each May 23, the birthday of 18th-century Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus, who is considered the father of modern taxonomy. It is "a way to call attention to species that are going extinct faster than they are being identified," the institute said in the release.

Scientists believe 10 million species await discovery, five times the number that are already known to science.

The Top 10 New Species of 2014

This small mammal with fluffy red-orange fur, a short bushy tail, and an adorable, rounded face has leapt onto the raccoon family tree. Last summer, Scientists at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington announced the discovery of a new species of mammal called the olinguito (pronounced oh-lin-GHEE-toe) -- the first mammalian carnivore species to be newly identified in the Americas in 35 years, according to Kristofer Helgen, curator of mammals at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History.

Previously, scientists had assumed that olinguitos were members of their sister species, the olingos, Helgen said in August when the discovery was announced. Olingos are larger, less furry and have longer faces than the newly discovered species.

Researchers say the olinguito primarily eats fruits, but also insects and nectar, and its activity is mostly at night. The animal lives in the trees and can jump from one to another. At about 2 feet long from nose to tail, the olinguito weighs about 2 pounds and is a little smaller than a house cat. The olinguito's misty, high-elevation habitats in Colombia and Ecuador, and the tendency for the animal to stay in the trees, helped keep the species relatively obscure to scientists previously, Helgen said.

With its significant height and trunk diameter and multiple branches, it's hard to believe that the Dracaena kaweesakii went undiscovered until now. The species, a relative of the Canary Island dragon tree, was identified on the limestone hills and mountains of Thailand. Cream-colored flowers with bright orange filaments bloom from the tree. Because of the low number of plants -- about 2,500 -- scientists believe the tree is endangered.

Scientists with Antarctic Geological Drilling Program (ANDRILL) were studying ocean currents under Antarctica's ice shelf. Setting out to test a camera-equipped robot, they discovered the Edwardsiella andrillae actually living in the ice. The sea anemones are less than an inch long and have between 20-24 tentacles that protrude in the chilly waters. While Antarctica is full of variations of sea anemone, these are the only known to actually live in the ice and it's still uncertain how they are able to withstand the harsh conditions in which they live.

The Libropus minusculus gives whole new meaning to "popcorn shrimp," though the skeleton shrimp likely won't be showing up on any seafood buffets any time soon. The male measures just 3.3 millimeters (about an eighth of an inch) and the female is even smaller -- just 2.1 millimeters. The translucent crustacean was collected from a cave on Santa Catalina, off the coast of Southern California.

This "new fungus among us," is bright orange when produced in colonies. The fungus was identified in a journal published by the National Herbarium of the Netherlands, and was named as a tribute to the Dutch royal family, specifically His Royal Highness the Prince of Orange. This new species "was isolated from soil in Tunisia," the release said.

You might have to look hard for this gecko. Not only was it discovered in an isolated rainforest in the Melville Range of eastern Australia, but its long, slender body, short head and spotted coloring help the creature stay hidden in the rocky terrains where it lives. Despite its characteristically "leaflike" wide tail, which also serves as camouflage, the gecko only measures around 4 inches long. The Saltuarius eximius tends to sit and wait for its prey and usually comes out at night.

At 4 to 5 centimeters in length (1 to 2 inches), the Spiculosiphon oceana is one of the largest unicellular organisms in the Mediterranean Sea. The body of the creature is stalklike, expanding to a bulb with spicules, like microscopic tentacles, that absorb food like a sponge. The Spiculosophon oceana lives off the southeast coast of Spain in underwater caves.

In an effort to prevent unauthorized earthly organisms from making their way into space, NASA makes every effort to disinfect rooms where spacecraft are assembled. Yet, it was in two of these "clean rooms" -- 2,500 miles away from each other -- at Kennedy Space Center in Florida and European Space Agency in French Guiana -- where the microbial species Tersicoccus phoenicis was discovered. The berry-shaped bacteria can withstand stresses such as drying, chemical cleaning, ultraviolet treatments and lack of nutrients, and also show elevated resistance to spacecraft sterilization methods such as heating and peroxide treatment.

Don't let the name fool you -- while Tinkerbella nana evokes images of Peter Pan's angelic fairy friend, this species, found in rainforests of Costa Rica, is the newest member of the wasp family. Tinkerbella nana measures 250 micrometers (0.00984 inches) long, just 2.5 times the width of a human hair. Dr. John Noyes, one of the scientists who made the discovery, called finding the insect "the equivalent to finding a solitary needle in 200 haystacks."

9 places on Earth we know very little about

The land snail was found nearly 3,000 feet below the surface of the Lukina Jama-Trojama caves. Its nearly translucent shell gives the animal a ghostly appearance, the release said, and the species doesn't have eyes. At just 2 millimeters in length, this "slower than a snail" snail may cruise the water currents or take a ride atop a bat or a cricket to get where it's going, scientists believe.</text>

<title>White House outs CIA official by mistake</title>
<text>
(CNN) -- The White House accidentally revealed the name of the CIA's top intelligence official in Afghanistan to some 6,000 journalists.

The person was included on a list of people attending a military briefing for President Barack Obama during his surprise visit to Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan on Sunday.

It's common for such lists to be given to the media, but names of intelligence officials are rarely provided. In this case, the individual's name was listed next to the title, "Chief of Station."

The print pool reporter -- a journalist allowed access to or is given information about an event who relays it to the rest of the media -- copied and pasted the list that was provided by the White House.

Print pool reports are then distributed by the White House press office, which does not edit them, to a large list of media.

In this case, the same reporter, Scott Wilson, the White House bureau chief for the Washington Post, noticed the unusual entry after the list was distributed and then checked it out with officials. The White House followed up and distributed a shorter list from a different reporter that did not include the station chief's name.

In his account to CNN, Wilson said when they arrived in Afghanistan, he asked White House officials for a list of who would be briefing the President.

A White House official then asked the military for a list to provide to the pool of journalists. The official got an e-mail back from the military with a subject line, "manifest for briefing for Pool," Wilson told CNN. That e-mail was forwarded to Wilson and he proceeded to copy and paste that list for the pool report. He then sent it to the White House official, who sent the report to the distribution list.

After the initial report had been issued, Wilson noticed that the chief of station had been identified in the list, which he flagged to the White House official. After checking with the military, the White House official said, "This is a problem."

The official asked if Wilson would write another pool report, asking journalists to disregard the previous report that contained the list with the chief of station's name. Wilson said he was open to the request and sent the White House a new report. He said he was unsure whether that report was distributed.

The new list, Wilson said, was distributed by a separate pool report that included details from Obama's speech to the troops. That report included a shorter list of names with a note saying, "this is the correct list of participants."

Privately administration officials are alarmed about the incident, but so far the White House and CIA officials have declined to comment publicly.

A station chief heads the CIA's office in a foreign country, establishing a relationship with its host intelligence service and overseeing agency activities.

The identity of station chiefs, like most CIA officers, are rarely disclosed to protect them and their ability to operate secretly.

Given the potentially dangerous nature of the situation, CNN has not broadcast or published online the name of the official.

In the most recent case before this one, the Bush administration infamously leaked the name of former CIA officer Valerie Plame to a journalist in 2003.

Plame tweeted on Monday that the White House's mistake this past weekend is "astonishing."

<title>CNN International named 'News Channel of the Year' at RTS awards</title>
<text>
(CNN) -- CNN International was named News Channel of the Year for the second year running at the Royal Television Society Awards in London on Wednesday, beating off competition from the BBC and Sky News.

The network also won the coveted Best News Coverage -- International category for its reporting of Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines.

The network's coverage of news events such as the Westgate Mall siege in Nairobi, the struggle for power in Egypt, the devastation of Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, the on-going crisis in Syria, and the rise of extremism in the former Soviet republic of Dagestan, won the votes of the jury at the UK-based media society.

Tony Maddox, executive vice president of CNN International, said: "To win News Channel of the Year for the second year running, against some strong submissions from our peers, is a very special honor. Our profession is being tested today more than ever before, but the bravery, determination, skill and fortitude of my colleagues around the world has been unwavering.

"Our coverage of Typhoon Haiyan was exemplary from start to finish. Our crews showed enormous bravery as well as great sensitivity on what was both a physically grueling, emotionally draining, and very important assignment. I'm delighted that their efforts have been recognized here, and I couldn't be more proud of their work."

The Royal Television Society (RTS) is Britain's leading forum for television and related media. The RTS Television Journalism Awards celebrate creative and excellent journalism in UK news and current affairs, both by organizations broadcasting in the UK and by companies that supply UK news broadcasters.

CNN's second consecutive win at the RTS awards is the latest honor for the network. The channel was recently named Cable & Satellite Channel of the Year at the Asian Television Awards, and had a strong showing in the Emmys, FPA Awards, Peabody Awards and the Overseas Press Awards.

CNN is also the number one international TV news channel according to all major media surveys across Europe, the Middle East and Africa, the Asia Pacific region and Latin America.</text>

<title>The numbers that show Africa is buzzing with entrepreneurial spirit</title>
<text>
(CNN) -- From ambitious teens taking on the world and tech pioneers breaking boundaries to maverick slum dwellers dreaming big and trailblazing innovators tackling social problems, CNN's African Start-Up has been following the efforts of the continent's innovative and determined entrepreneurs to make their business dreams become reality.

Indeed, all across the continent, a growing wave of grassroots self-starters are taking risks and defying obstacles to bring their money-making ideas to life. Armed with a can-do attitude and hopes of striking it big, they're navigating a conundrum of challenges to pursue opportunities at a time when many African countries enjoy unprecedented levels of economic growth.

"The entrepreneurial landscape in sub-Saharan Africa is absolutely excellent," says Mike Herrington, executive director of Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) and professor at the University of Cape Town in South Africa. "It's on the increase because Africa, at last, has been emerging and the economies are booming -- several countries are starting to really increase entrepreneurial activity and move to opportunity entrepreneurship, rather than necessity entrepreneurship," he adds. "Opportunities abound and a positive spirit is emerging amongst the population of these countries."

So, Africa's entrepreneurial spirit is alive and thriving -- but how does it compare to the rest of the world?

Earlier this year, GEM published its annual report looking at the state of entrepreneurship globally. It found that sub-Saharan Africa is the region with by far the highest number of people involved in early-stage entrepreneurial activity (TEA), with Zambia and Nigeria leading the world rankings.

Africa also leads the world in the number of women starting businesses, with almost equal levels of male and female entrepreneurs. In fact, in countries like Ghana, Nigeria and Zambia the women outnumber the men.

Overall, the continent has a much higher proportion of female entrepreneurs compared to other regions, with Nigeria and Zambia (both 40.7%) coming on top and countries like the United States (10.4%), the UK (5.5%), Norway (3.6%) and France (3.1%) lagging far behind.

According to Herrington, the main reason for this is because women in Africa "need to earn an extra income" to be able to afford "to send their children to school."

Getting off the ground

Yet, does the high number of both male and female entrepreneurs tell the whole story? And do these impressive figures translate to sustainable startups that are able to grow and provide employment to the continent's young population?

In its analysis, GEM groups countries into geographic regions, but also according to their development stage: factor-driven, efficiency-driven and innovation-driven, each suggesting an increasing level of sophistication in the operation of the economy (see fact box on the left).

Most African nations surveyed are placed into the factor-driven stage, where early-stage entrepreneurial activity rates tend to be higher than the rates of owner-managers in established businesses (running more than three and a half years).

In other words, "a high entrepreneurship rate does not necessarily mean the creation of a lot of jobs," explains Herrington. "Those countries with low GDP per capita tend to have a very high entrepreneurial rate, because the larger corporations are not taking up a lot people to provide them with the so-called formal employment," he adds.

Similarly, the continent might be buzzing with startups, but how long do these last?

According to GEM, the rate of business discontinuance tends to decrease as economic development increases. As a result, countries like Malawi and Angola that see many new businesses also experience high numbers of people abandoning their efforts after failing to make profits.

"The discontinuance of businesses in the factor-driven economies is very high," says Herrington, citing "the lack of education, market research and access to funding" as the main reasons.

There are several factors hindering the survival and growth of small businesses in Africa -- little government support, bureaucracy and lack of financial backing to cite a few more. Yet, all these constraints do little to prevent the continent's budding entrepreneurs from trying their luck.

True, entrepreneurs might be optimistic by nature, but nowhere else in the world is this key drive toward success as present as in Africa.

The continent's entrepreneurs boast the lowest levels of "fear of failure," with just 24% responding that it would stop from starting a business and seizing business opportunities. In countries like Zambia, Uganda and Malawi the figure drops to as little as 15% -- compare that to countries like the UK (36.4%) and the United States. (31%).

All you need is confidence

It's no surprise then that African entrepreneurs are also the most confident in the world in their ability and skills to start a business. In comparison, people in Malawi feel twice as self-assured about launching a startup as those in the UK.

Likewise, sub-Saharan Africa claims the top five spots for countries where people see good opportunities for starting a business and feel positive about entrepreneurship.

Herrington says that it's these qualities, coupled with a need for better education and a focus on moving entrepreneurs from necessity to opportunity, that will drive the continent's development.

"Africa is going to have to rely on small businesses (SMEs) to provide the bulk of the employment," he says. "In a lot of countries the SMEs contribute more than 50% of the GDP and more than 50% of employment, so if you're going to employ people in Africa and other developing countries it's SMEs are the ones that are going to provide that."</text>

<title>An empty Everest: But should you climb?</title>
<text>
(CNN) -- At Camp 3 of Mount Everest at an altitude of 7,200 meters, an American woman, 50-year-old Cleonice Pacheco Weidlich, sits in a solitary tent.

Outside, fierce winds of more than 50 knots are raging.

Soon blizzard-bearing monsoon clouds will gather around Everest and bring an end to the climbing season on the high Himalayas.

It will also draw a shroud over one of the single deadliest tragedies the world's highest mountain has ever witnessed.

Before she can make begin her ascent, Weidlich must not only find a gap in the weather and a way over the avalanche, but also face down the growing controversies that erupted around continued activity on Everest in the wake of the disaster.

More than 300 international climbers abandoned their goal of reaching the mountain's summit after an April 18 avalanche in the mountain's treacherous Khumbu Icefall killed 16 Nepalese Sherpa mountaineers.

The immediate aftermath of the disaster brought confusion and anger to the mountain as arguments raged over whether climbing should continue, the money paid to Sherpas and compensation for the sacrifices made.

Some Sherpas called an unofficial moratorium on further climbs, with one group even reportedly sabotaging equipment.

With safety in doubt, many international climbing companies decided to pull the plug, leading to a domino effect that also swept up the independent climbers who rely on shared resources.

"If 30% of your workforce walks away, it compromises your operational capabilities, given the difficulties of finding new porters, cooks, and guides in short time in the Khumbu," said one guide from a leading operator.

Many were resigned to the sudden end to the season.

"I feel very sad about the Sherpas," said Ake Lindstrom, an adventure operator from Tanzania.

"Everybody knows each other; it is a small community and their loss is very tangible. It takes a small amount of empathy to let go of one's frustration."

Later she was joined by Wang Jing, a 41-year-old Chinese woman also determined to press ahead with an attempt on the summit.

Despite their determination in the face of calls for a halt to climbing, many Sherpas CNN Travel spoke to were not unhappy with their plans.

Instead, they voiced other concerns, including the disparity they perceive between local and international guide salaries, overcrowding on the mountain, a lack of respect to their mountain god and those who died.

There was also anger towards the Nepalese government over its response to the tragedy.

Among the Everest climbing community questions were raised about the safety prior to the deaths.

Some Sherpas said there had been too many on the mountain on the day of the disaster, with long lines forming as people traversed the ladders over crevasses.

'One mistake and you are done'

"It was so packed that for some, there was no place to hide when the ice started to fall," one said. "We never saw so many people on the icefall on one day."

"The mountains are in constant movement, which is what makes the icefall dangerous," said Gian Piero Verza, of the Pyramid high-altitude research center, located at 5,050 meters on Everest.

"You have to consider that in two months of expeditions, some Sherpas spend an average of three hours daily on the icefall to carry their load. For some that is 200 hours in a very dangerous place."

Veteran expedition leader Jamie McGuinness, however, said he was surprised that more did not defy the exodus to take advantage of conditions similar to those when Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay first summited in 1953.

"Hard-core mountaineers would jump at the chance to have Everest and Lhotse all for themselves during the best climbing season," he says.

"But being there without backup is like being back in epic Hillary's time: one mistake and you are done."

Back at Camp 3, in her gale-battered tent, Weidlich is convinced she is doing the right thing by continuing with her plan to summit Lhotse, a peak connected to Everest's South Col.

She says she knows the family of one of the victims and when she visited them after the disaster was not met with hostility and was invited to stay for the funeral.

"I asked them if they felt it would be disrespectful if I continued with my climbing plan," she says. "They were concerned about my safety, but they never brought up the issue of respect."

Weidlich, who is on a personal mission to climb all 14 of the world's mountains over 8,000 meters, says the problem lies with assisted climbing.

"High mountains are dangerous, and climbing is all about the experience. You have to evaluate the risks. But Everest has become a completely different place: it is a showtime place. People come here to make silly records.

"This is not real mountaineering. To me, if you cannot free climb a mountain and you need someone else to help you up or down, you don't belong on it."

Weidlich hits out at claims that Sherpas had forced people to abandon the mountain saying they had treated her well.

She also speaks of the excitement of climbing in isolation.

"I am very much looking forward to experiencing the mountain for what it is, without the crowds. It will be rewarding to be in contact with nature -- to hear the cracking of the ice and not the generators."

When at last the gales ease, it is finally time for Weidlich to face the mountain, but she is ultimately unable to reach her goal.

Because of the dangers on the Icefall, both Weidlich and Wang bypass it using helicopters -- a highly controversial move that could invalidate any claim to a successful climb.

Wang reaches the summit of Everest on May 23 along with five Sherpas.

Weidlich, however, decides to abandon her attempt on Lhotse because "that would be like claiming a whole mountain when I would only have climbed half of it."

Shortly afterward, the monsoon closes in for good, leaving Everest to brood alone over another season of triumphs for some and tragedies for others.

<title>'Mad Men' at midseason: So much right stuff, yet feeling lost in space</title>
<text>
Waterloo was one more episode of Mad Men this season that used iconic historical references to imbue the narrative with dread and toy with our pessimistic assumptions about Don Draper and friends (and frenemies). The titlea nod to Napoleons last, losing battlegot us worrying that personal agendas would cause Don to sabotage the Burger Chef pitch or Peggy to botch it, or that the forces opposing their self-realization (the Cutler/Lou conspiracy thwarting Dons atonement; the chauvinist, unjust culture impeding Peggys advancement) would win the day.

Instead, with the livelihoods on the line and all eyes watching, Don and Peggy rose to the occasionchastened Don stayed the course of humility; ascendant Peggy showed she had all the right stuffmuch like the astronauts of Apollo 11, whose history-making moon landing on July 20, 1969, a global spectacle watched by 500 million people, provided the episode with its other frame of reference. Theportrayal of the media event in Waterloo played like a requiem for broadcast TV monoculture. Peggy, in a bit of business geniusthat caused Don to beam with pride, exploited the moment (and pulled from her life as landlord/surrogate parent to poor, Newark-bound Julio) to add some extra idealistic/maudlin Family of Man flavor to her Burger Chef pitch. Fast food will save the world!

Mad Mens dramatization ofthe Apollo 11 mission also reminded usor if we werent alive to witness it, taught usthat Neil Armstrong and companys trip to the moon was a nail-biting thriller that had the world fretting about whetherit would all end in disaster. Watching theMad Mengang watching television with moon-shot jitters = the Mad Men audience, watching the final season full of worry, or for some of you, certainty, about another Don Draper implosion. Again, I say, this season seems to be interested in tracing the origins of contemporary cultural cynicism, functioning as a Rorschach blot that reflects back to us the degree to which weve been infected by it, and, perhaps, challenging its hold. Do you want your brothers to think like that? Don asked Sally in response to her cynicalDon used the wordresponse to Armstrongs giant leap for mankind, a pose she swiped from the cool older boy visiting her home. No, she replied, with a smile that suggested she appreciated being called out, especially from her fallen but improving father. She expects him to aspire to a better version of himself; maybe she should do the same.

Of course, catastrophe did strike Mad Men during Waterloo in the form of Bert Coopers surprising, off-camera death. That moon landing sent his heart racing (Bravo!his final word) and then, apparently, over the edge. (I like to think hes now somewhere over the moon, bounding around with the astronaut in his life, Mrs. Blankenship.) And yet, despite (or in spite of) this tragedy, can-do heroic optimism ruled the day, as grief was assuaged when Roger Sterling, answering the challenge of Coopers view of him as leadership-challenged, reclaimed control of his agency (in more ways than one) by privately securing a lucrative sale to McCann-Erickson, this subverting the Napoleonic machinations of Jim Cutler that would have sentRoger and Don out to pasture.

I didnt quite buy Team Rogers view that Jims vision, with its emphasis on cutting edge technology and precision media buying, represented a corruption of the agencys identity as a creative-oriented boutique. Its all advertising, not life-affirming, soul-enriching art, as Teds recent turn toward self-loathing reminded us. Jims vision, Rogers visiontomato, tomahto. Today, we cheer Roger: for his heroic hustle, for honoring his mentor/partners memory and legacy. But it also represents an aging, fading mans desperate attempt to hold onto the past, deny the present, fight the future that is already here. This is to say nothing of the potential costs to SC&Ps self-governance and self-determination by becoming someone elses property: Not for nothing, I think, that we saw Rogers Inferno print looming in the establishing shot of the scene in which he sprung the McCann deal on the partners. Read: a deal with the devil? Itll be interesting to see when Mad Men resumes next year if Roger negotiated a new lease on life or signed the agencys death warrant.

Speaking of the intermission that is upon us: I hate it. Its not just that the season has me hooked and I want the next chapters now. I dont think Mad Mens approach to scaling seasonsevery episode a finely crafted gem unto itself; slowly emerging big picture narrativesworks well in the split season format.Mad Men 7Adoesnt leave me with the same satisfaction that, say, the first half of Breaking Bads final season gave me, the kind of satisfaction that makes a many-month break tolerable and stokes anticipation for whats left. Im ready for this story to end. Now. In truth, Ive been ready since the end of last season, after Dons powerful if exhausting downward spiral toward rock bottom. I love this show, but Im burned out on it, too.I think about waiting until 2015 to see the rest of this season and feel cranky and tired, not amped. Yeah, Ill watch it, anyway. But grumble-grumble-grumble. You know?

Maybe its a mistake to evaluate the whole ofMad Men 7A without seeing Mad Men 7B. Its entirely possible that the back half might illuminate and fulfill the design of the first half in ways not yet apparent. For example, I am reluctant to pass any judgment or come to any conclusions about the shows treatment of Betty so far this season (what little treatment theres beenmore story for her next year, please!), and Sally is a fuzzy picture still coming into focus. I live in hope for closure for Ginsberg and his bloody nipple.That said, as much as season 7 has so far given us some classic episodesthe last two in particularand many sensational moments, Im tempted to say 7A was less than the sum of its parts.

I enjoyed watching Don struggle to repair the broken vessel of his life by being a better husband, father, and worker. The things that frustrated and challenged his reclamation projecthis own self-doubt; the doubts of others; lingering resentments about past sins; changing times and circumstanceswere usually compelling. The conclusions felt correct, even provocative. I loved how Sally rewarded Dons honesty and transparency with grace and a sincere I love you, dad in the Valentines Day episode. Peggys slow dance with Don, the culmination of an episode that saw Don earn back Peggys trust and affirmation by affirming her talent, was a glorious moment. Mad Men rocked the role reversal in their relationship. I think we were all anticipating it, even hoped for it; the way Weiner and his writers, directors, and actors made it happen was surprising all the same and more delightful than I imagined.

Still, Dons progression should have been allowed to unfold more leisurely, with a bit more mess; it felt squished into this seven episode set for the sake of giving the first half of the season a distinct identity. I would have liked to have seen a little more trial and error, a little more failure and folly, and with an extra episode or two, we could have gotten that. As it was, Dons arc was a series of Don Making Nice With The Ladies moments, with forgiveness and restoration coming just a little too easily, too quickly. (Joan remains a work in progress; maybe next year.) Don even nailedhis inevitable break-up with Megan, who gave him maybe the most charitable no-fault divorce California has ever seen. You dont owe me anything, she told Don after he vowed to take care of her until she was well established. Shes wrong, of course. We know that. Don knows that. But ignorance is bliss. Thats what get-lost payoffs to inconvenient women from your husbands past are for.

What sticks with me most right now is the look on Dons face during the inspired climactic scene of Waterloo, a waking hallucination in which Bert called to him in the hallway, sashayed sockless with prancing secretaries and serenaded him him with The Best Things in Life are Free. It was a great exit for actor Robert Morse, but the importance of the scene, the meaning of it all, lies in Dons emotional response to what hes witnessing. (My general rule for all bizarre dream sequences.) In Dons face, I saw confusion and grief and terror; it reminded me of astronaut David Bowmans fear and trembling response to passing through the monolith and landing in the Hotel Suite of Cosmic Transformation at the end of 2001.

The scene ends with Bert shutting a doorand Don taking a seat. Interesting: Shut The Door. Have A Seat was the season 3 finale, the one whereSterling Cooper revolted against a sale to McCann, Don granted Betty a friendly divorce, and The Man Formerly Known As Dick Whitman reflected on his fathers death. When we came back to Don at the start of season 4, we found Don falling apart personally (a downward spiral that culminated with The Suitcase) and the Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce start-up struggling to start. Now, he finds himself in a similar placea clean slate; a place of transformation and reinventionand I wonder if what troubled him so much and brought him low was remembering that the last time he was in this spot he well, imploded. Will this time be any different? Can Don Draper rise to the challenge of living well amid the pressure of building anew, the uncertainty that attends all new beginnings, and the lingering doubts about his own character? I look forward to watching the spectacle of the answer, even as it drives me crazy that Mad Men is making me wait for it.</text>

Ahead of crucial elections that will determine not just Ukraines future, but the stability of the whole region, it's important to look back and remember exactly how all this started.

It began back in December, when then-President Viktor Yunukovych backed out of a partnership deal with the EU after pressure from Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Producer Andrew Tkach and independent Ukrainian filmmakers Babylon 13" have made a new short film, Memories of Maidan  a ground-level view on the front lines of Kievs Independence Square.

The voices of ordinary Ukrainian protesters relive their gripping memories of Maidan  the tsunami that brought Ukraine and Russia to the brink of war, saw Crimea annexed, and precipitated the deepest chill between Moscow and the West since the Cold War.</text>

<title>What were China's hacker spies after?</title>
<text>
That's what Chinese hackers were looking for, according to federal prosecutors who have charged members of the Chinese military with cyber theft and more.

The 31-count indictment, revealed Monday, marks a dramatic escalation of U.S. government efforts to combat Chinese state-sponsored corporate espionage.

"The Chinese are going after every single economic advantage they can obtain," said former federal prosecutor Thomas Brown, now a cybersecurity expert with FTI Consulting. "Decades of time spent developing technologies are being ripped off and stolen everyday."

Here's what the feds say the Chinese hackers did:

China has denied the allegations, saying it has never engaged in the cyber theft of trade secrets.

The kind of spying China is accused of can yield valuable information and give the country's businesses a much-needed boost. Westinghouse spent a significant amount of money designing the special pipes that are the defining feature of its AP1000 pressurized water reactor. Stealing those plans means that a Chinese nuclear plant builder might be able to skip costly research and development.

"How much money is spent on failures? The Chinese can avoid all that," said Christopher Tarbell, a former member of the FBI's cybercrime squad.

This is a particularly critical issue in the solar power industry, where Chinese manufacturers have flooded the global market with cheap solar panels and undercut U.S. firms. SolarWorld issued a statement thanking the U.S. Justice Department for stepping in.

"It's yet another example of the Chinese government's systematic campaign to seek unfair advantage in the U.S and global solar industry. Already, dozens of U.S. companies have closed operations, and thousands of U.S. employees have lost their jobs," SolarWorld said.

Why all the attention paid to steel? American metal is consistently better quality. It's not enough to melt iron ore, coal and limestone. Forging it is an art with highly-guarded secrets. Chinese manufacturers are good at making low-cost steel used in bridges, but American firms are better at making the lightweight versions used in fuel-efficient cars.

The steelworkers union called the revelation "troubling." Alcoa downplayed the news, saying "no material information was compromised." Westinghouse and U.S. Steel declined to comment.

In total, secretive economic attacks cost U.S. firms billions in lost profits and destroyed jobs, said cybersecurity expert David Kennedy, whose TrustedSec firm advises companies that have been attacked this way.

And once the hackers have breached a company's defenses, it's much easier to make the leap from data theft to outright sabotage. Hackers with access to the computers that control a factory's machines, for example, might be able to disrupt the production process just before a pivotal delivery deadline.

"That's not farfetched at all," warned Jonathan Pollet, a hacker who founded Red Tiger Security and advises energy companies.</text>

<title>3 missing after massive mudslide in western Colorado</title>
<text>
(CNN) -- Rescue workers searched by air and on land Monday for three people missing after a massive mudslide in Mesa County, Colorado.

"Everybody on this mountain is praying for a miracle right now. We hope that they may be stranded somewhere, or in such a way that they avoided it. But right now, they have not been heard from," Mesa County Sheriff Stan Hilkey told reporters.

On Sunday morning, a small slide impacted irrigation water for local ranchers and farmers, he said. The three men now missing went to investigate what had happened, which is when authorities believe a second and major mudslide occurred.

The slide followed a day of rain and is located about 11 miles southeast of the town of Collbran, a community of about 700 people in western Colorado.

Late Monday, authorities identified those missing as Clancy Nichols, 51, his son, Danny Nichols, 24, and Wes Hawkins, 46.

"It's an understatement to say that it is massive," Hilkey said about the slide. It's estimated to be about 4 miles long, 2 miles wide and about 250 feet deep.

There were no reports of damage to structures in the remote area.

"The slide came down with so much force and velocity that it came to a hill and went up and over a hill and then came back down -- a significant hill. So the power behind it was remarkable," the sheriff said.

With the help of a helicopter, more than three dozen emergency and search-and-rescue personnel are on scene. The area remains unstable, and authorities are concerned about the possibility of yet another slide.

Roadblocks have been set up to keep people away.

"We have to be comfortable ... before we're going to put and allow search-and-rescue resources on there because we certainly don't want to create any more of a tragedy than this already is," said Hilkey.

<title>Barcelona appoints Luis Enrique as new manager</title>
<text>
Follow us at @WorldSportCNN and like us on Facebook

(CNN) -- Barcelona has appointed Luis Enrique as the club's new manager just days after losing out on the La Liga title.

Enrique, who has resigned from his role at Celta Vigo following a successful season in charge, returns to the club where he starred as a player between 1996 and 2004.

The 44-year-old has signed a two-year deal and replaces Tata Martino, who left the club after just one season at the helm.

In a statement, the club confirmed that Enrique was appointed following an endorsement from sporting director, Andoni Zubizarreta.

Barcelona endured a disappointing season, failing to retain its league title and crashing out of the Champions League following a defeat by Atletico Madrid.

Atletico also pipped Barca to the league title by securing a final day draw at Camp Nou on Saturday.

Martino's side was also beaten by arch-rival Real Madrid in last month's Copa del Rey final.

His departure, which came following Saturday's draw, raised few eyebrows following a reign perpetuated by rumors of unrest within the camp.

The attention will now turn to Enrique, who guided Celta to an impressive ninth place finish in La Liga.

Enrique, who arrived at the club for the first time as a player in 18 years ago following a move from Real Madrid, became a huge favorite with the club's supporters.

He won two league titles, two Spanish Cups, a European Cup Winners Cup and a European Super Cup during his eight years at the Camp Nou.

Enrique played 300 games for the club, scoring 109 goals and captained the side between 2002-2004 before retiring.

In 2008, the former Spain international coached Barcelona B, winning promotion in his second season in charge before leaving to take over at Italian side Roma three years later.

At Roma, he guided the club to a seventh place finish in Serie A and into the semifinals of the Italian Cup.

He left his post after citing fatigue.

The confirmation of Enrique's appointment came shortly after Lionel Messi signed a new deal with the club, which reportedly takes his net annual salary to $27.4 million.

Messi agreed the deal last Friday but put pen to paper on the new contract Monday.

The Argentina striker has had a lean season by his own impossibly high standards, but has still scored 28 La Liga goals in his 30 games.

Messi joined the Catalans in 2000 at the age of 13 and has gone on to win 21 trophies with Barca, including six La Liga titles and three European Champions League crowns.

The 26-year was also voted World Player of the Year in four successive seasons, between 2009 and 2012, and will be one of the biggest names at the World Cup in Brazil.

Barcelona has also announced the signing of Borussia Mnchengladbach goalkeeper Marc-Andr Ter Stegen, who is expected to become the club's first-choice next season.</text>

<title>JetBlue's weird password rule: No Q or Z</title>
<text>
The dangerously lame "Password1" is okay, but "QueazyQuetzal" is not. How quizzical.

As it turns out, the rule stems from the old school limitations of making travel reservations by phone.

First a little history. Booking flights in the 1950's was a total pain. Without a computer network to avoid double-booking a seat, airline operators would huddle close together and jot down reservations by hand.

That went away in the 1960's after American Airlines ( Fortune 500) to develop SABRE, a revolutionary computer system that could process -- in real time -- sales agents' 83,000 daily phone calls.

But rotary and touch-tone phones at the time didn't have a 'Q' or 'Z.' The number 1 belonged to long distance calls, and 0 for the operator. That left eight numbers to cover the entire alphabet. Bell Telephone Company assigned three letters to each number and left out the two letters we use least: 'Q' and 'Z.'

That's how airlines became dependent on a phone-based reservation system with a limited alphabet.

Fast forward to today. Sabre ( Fortune 500). Old rules die hard, and JetBlue tells CNN the "No Q or Z" rule still applies for JetBlue employees accessing the Sabre system.

JetBlue passed that restriction along to TrueBlue members for their passwords, as described in this company password FAQ, Two reporters at Quartz tweeted about the quandary Wednesday.

But the rule was quietly dropped and is no longer active. You can currently create nearly any password you want, as long as it's between eight and 20 characters.

JetBlue told CNN it's now updating its FAQ page, but the company wouldn't comment on when they changed the rule.

So, next time you reset an airline membership password, go ahead and use all the Qs and Zs you'd like.</text>

<title>10 gay honeymoon hotspots</title>
<text>
(CNN) -- Gay couples can now legally marry in 18 countries -- a statistic that increasingly raises an important question: Where's the best spot for a same-sex honeymoon?

More and more destinations are now catering to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) travelers.

John Tanzella, chief executive of the International Gay and Lesbian Travel Association, says it's an encouraging trend, but he worries there's a risk of gay vacationers being targeted as a "niche."

"When you're planning that dream trip it's still important to work with travel professionals who understand the needs of gay travelers as individuals," he adds.

Among travel organizations that seem to be getting the message is the Association of British Travel Agents, which is the latest to compile a list of destinations offering same-sex honeymooners a friendly atmosphere and catering to a broad range of tastes.

The dramatic backdrop of Table Mountain rises above this gorgeous city bathed in almost year-round sunshine.

It's a great place to relax for a couple of days, then travel out to the numerous wineries in the lush green countryside close to the city.

Where else can you see penguins sunning themselves on a beach?

Cape Town is considered the most gay-friendly city in Africa and attracts LGBT people from across the continent, adding to an interesting local cultural mix.

The gay village, with its range of clubs, bars, bathhouses, cafes and guesthouses is in De Waterkant.

Tel Aviv calls itself a 24-hour city because you can spend all night clubbing then snooze all day on one of its beaches.

If you've time to spare, you can squeeze ancient and Biblical sites such as the Dead Sea, Masada and Jerusalem into one- or two-day trips.

Honeymoon hotspot: Tel Aviv doesn't have a gay village because the whole city considers itself gay-friendly, but Rothschild Avenue is a particular focus, where as many same-sex couples walk hand in hand as straight couples.

Brighton is, without doubt, Britain's gayest town and has an anything-goes reputation not just for romance, but also for art, clubbing and all kinds of culture.

The beach may be rainy outside of summer, but even in winter there's a certain beauty to the place, and it's only an hour by train from London.

Brighton town also sports some exotic-looking buildings, such as the Royal Pavilion, an 18th-century regent's folly built in a classical Indian style.

Honeymoon hotspot: Club Revenge (32-34 Old Steine St., Brighton; +44 1273 606 064) has been a fixture of gay Brighton's nightlife for two decades.

Honeymoon hotspot: The gay village centers on the Blue Chairs (Malecn y Almendro No. 4, Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco; +52 322 222 5040) resort section of the beach, where there's raucous entertainment at night.

Sydney's gay pride march is the biggest and brashest in the world.

The city is famously LGBT-friendly, nowhere more so than the center of gay Sydney: Taylor Square on Oxford Street.

The city's bars and restaurants are some of the best in the world, so it's a great place for foodie couples -- particularly the pricey venues in the Rock's area.

Honeymoon hotspot: As a harbor city, Sydney offers opportunities to polish surfing skills on some of the local beaches, such as the world-famous Bondi -- which claims to be the location of the first ever gay surfers' group surf.

The center for Spain's gay scene is 20 miles (32 kilometers) along the coast from the stunning architecture and cultural life of Barcelona.

Once just a fishing village, in the 20th century it became a haven for artists including Picasso, and now welcomes an international gay community.

The town has a calendar of annual events including the town carnival, a film festival, a classic car rally and the full range of traditional Spanish village religious festivals.

Honeymoon hotspot: Parrots (Carrer de Joan Tarrida, 16, Sitges, Barcelona; +34 938 94 13 50) one of the city's best-known gay hotels, also has its own popular gay cafe.

<title>West's biggest threat: Battle-hardened homegrown terrorists</title>
<text>
Editor's note: Andrew Hammond is a former UK government special adviser, and an associate at LSE IDEAS at the London School of Economics. The views expressed are solely his own.

London (CNN) -- Friday marks the anniversary of the assassination of Osama bin Laden in Pakistan by U.S. forces. Three years on, the core organization of al Qaeda has been significantly depleted. However, the danger from so-called "home-grown" terrorism may yet be on the rise, fuelled by foreign nationals returning from key international theatres of war such as Syria.

In the United Kingdom, for instance, Charles Farr, director of the Office for Security and Counter-terrorism, recently asserted that the threat from UK nationals travelling to participate in the Syrian conflict is the "biggest challenge" to UK security services since 9/11. The total number of UK nationals who have fought in Syria is estimated at up to 366 by the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation (ICSR) at Kings College London, with a significant number believed to have been killed there.

Moreover, ICSR estimates that as many as 11,000 foreign fighters overall may have fought in Syria, from more than 70 countries, a number which is reported to be a higher concentration than anywhere since Afghanistan in the 1980s. A central concern here is that many of these individuals, which include potentially as many as 2,000 from Western Europe, plus individuals from North America, Australia, South-east Asia, and Africa, will return from Syria to their respective homelands battle hardened with significantly greater terrorist capability and resolve.

And given that the relatively large number of these foreign fighters makes them collectively difficult to track with precision, further home-grown attacks appear increasingly likely. While this offers propaganda value for al Qaeda, such individuals often lack thorough indoctrination of the network's core messages, even though some, including last year's London and Boston terrorists, appear to have been partially motivated or inspired by them.

This reflects, in part, the continued diminution of al Qaeda's central organization which is unlikely to be able to provide operational support for home-grown terrorists. It also means that these people, while highly dangerous, do not individually represent the same level of threat to international interests as larger cells and terrorist groups, and are thus less likely to be able to perform major, spectacular attacks in the mould of 9/11.

Thus, while bin Laden's successor, Ayman al-Zawahiri, has sought to seize on home-grown Western terrorism, and indeed the chaos in Syria, for propaganda purposes, this cannot disguise the central al Qaeda organization's declining fortunes. Al-Zawahiri lacks bin Laden's personal authority within the terrorist network, and the core has also been weakened by the assassination of numerous other senior terrorist leaders.

A fundamental challenge for al-Zawahiri is that while the central al Qaeda leadership appears to remain located largely in Pakistani tribal areas and borderlands, the wider network has becoming increasingly de-centralized and dispersed. The problems this can cause were underlined earlier this month in Syria when a jihadist group called Islamic State of Iraq and Greater Syria (ISIS) accused al Qaeda of having "deviated from the correct path," and "divided the mujahedeen in every place."

The origin of the dispute probably lies in an edict from al-Zawahiri to ISIS to confine its activities to Iraq after it was accused of abuses of civilians and rival rebels in Syria. Al-Zawahiri has instead recognized the al-Nusra Front as the official al Qaeda affiliate in Syria and called for jihadist unity behind it.

Accompanying this dispersal and de-centralization has been shifting the focus of al Qaeda groups and franchises whose attention is more on "local" national or regional issues, rather than the broader international designs of bin Laden. In part, this also reflects the greater difficulty of attacking key international targets many of whose defences have significantly hardened since 9/11.

There has also been evolution in the geographical focal points of al Qaeda activity with terrorist nodes of growing importance, for instance, in key African and Middle Eastern countries, such as Yemen, where political upheaval since bin Laden's death has allowed terrorists and other insurgents to secure greater foothold. And reflecting this changed risk pattern, U.S. forces are re-deploying as a result.

For instance, the CIA has expanded its staff in Yemen, and also enhanced its air bases in the Gulf from which it can launch drone strikes into the country. Only last week, Washington launched a major drone attack which, according to the Yemeni government, killed at least two dozen militants, including foreign fighters, in an al Qaeda training camp in the remote mountainous area of Abyan.

Meanwhile in Africa, U.S. forces have also scaled up facilities in numerous states, including Kenya, Ethiopia, and the Central African Republic. This is intended to allow for greater aerial surveillance coverage and drone strikes, especially in North Africa, plus sites for military hardware storage.

So while the central core of al Qaeda has been diminished since bin Laden's demise, much of the wider terrorist network remains potent, albeit more focused on local grievances than grander international ambitions. However, danger may be growing from home-grown threats fueled by battle-hardened individuals returning from foreign theaters of war, especially Syria, with greater terrorist resolve and capabilities.</text>

<title>Fistfights amid long bread lines in Venezuela</title>
<text>
(CNN) -- Shoppers in Venezuela know that shortages of staples like cornmeal, milk and chicken are a harsh reality of life, but now -- amid violent protests and strikes -- shortages have spread to that most basic of basics: bread.

Lines are forming, and fights have broken out outside bakeries as politicians and business leaders point fingers.

In recent days, people have had to wait in line for hours under the scorching sun. Ricardo Rodriguez, a Caracas resident waiting for the chance to buy bread, described the queues as "extraordinary."

"It's like embarking on an odyssey," he said.

The problem stems from labor, social unrest and currency regulation that ties to difficulties importing raw ingredients, according to Tomas Ramos Lopez, president of the Venezuelan Federation of Bread Producers.

Ramos told CNN en Espaol that the problem started last year when a strike stopped production at a flour mill in Monagas state that supplies 35% of all the flour in Venezuela.

Another problem, Ramos said, is all of Venezuela's wheat is imported from Canada, the United States and Argentina, and tight government-dictated currency controls have left producers in a situation where they don't have the dollars needed to import wheat.

A third problem, according to Ramos, has been social unrest. Violent anti-government protests in the past three months have disrupted distribution of flour. Bakers cannot get the raw ingredient in several cities across the country, especially San Cristobal, Valencia, Barquisimeto and Caracas, the capital.

The government blames the shortage on unscrupulous merchants and bakery owners who hoard their products in order to make a profit by selling at higher prices on the black market.

But Ramos said, "I believe that the national industry and the laws in Venezuela have to be changed. (Government officials) need to know the difference between hoarding and having inventory."

Venezuela regulates the price of bread, but neighboring Colombia doesn't. Officials say this creates a smuggling problem in border states, where food bought at Venezuela's artificially low prices can be taken across the border and sold at higher market prices.

The situation has turned chaotic in at least a couple of places. A surveillance video posted online shows a group of men breaking into a bakery at night in the city of Maracay to steal bread and whatever else they can carry. Another video on YouTube shows people fighting for bags of flour outside a store.

Luis Narvaez, a Caracas resident, explained the shortage problems in a simple way. "I would like to eat arepas (cornmeal flatbread, a national dish in Venezuela) but can't because there's no cornmeal. I would like to eat fried eggs, but there's no cooking oil."

Ramos says the supply of wheat flour is down 30% in cities like Merida, El Tigre and El Vigia and states like Tachira. In Amazonas state, he says, the shortage level is at 60%.

Some financial analysts like Orlando Ochoa say price regulation is at the heart of the problem. Ochoa told CNN affiliate Globovision that artificially low prices discourage production and, therefore, supply.

"The government tries to be pragmatic by not raising prices, which is a popular move. So what they do is focus their attention at the end of the production process, controlling prices to give the appearance they're doing something about this problem," Ochoa said.

The Venezuelan government is now focusing on enforcement. This month, 22 merchants were detained and accused of hoarding products and not complying with price regulations.

In February, President Nicolas Maduro called on all Venezuelans to reduce consumption to alleviate the shortages. "We need to stabilize consumption," he said, "as part of a new socially conscious behavior so that we avoid extreme consumerism made possible by the purchasing power the Venezuelan families now have."

But the opposition says these measures are a smokescreen that hides the real problem: failed socialist economic policies that have discouraged production and drive away foreign investment.</text>

<title>Comet to pass by Earth closely after Camelopardalids meteor shower</title>
<text>
Share your best shots of the meteor shower with CNN iReport, and you could be featured on CNN.

(CNN) -- So after all the hype, was the lost sleep and the sore necks from looking at the sky worth it?

People throughout North America could ask that question Saturday, hours after witnessing a unique meteor shower that was visible in the middle of the night.

Judging from social media responses, this cosmic event appeared to have little bang in some places, while delivering a few prize goods elsewhere.

But for die-hard star geeks, there will be an Act II, an even bigger treat, as the last part of the shower -- a comet -- passes by Earth, beginning Saturday evening.

Whatever the verdict, there will probably never be a second chance for the May Camelopardalids meteor shower. Many showers come annually, in October, December, January and April, said NASA meteor observer Bill Cooke.

In August, for example, we will see the return of the spectacular Perseid meteor shower.

But the Camelopardalids shower, named for the constellation the shooting stars appeared to fly out of, was a rare gift from the planet Jupiter.

The biggest planet in the solar system bent the meteors' orbit with its powerful gravitational pull so that they would collide with Earth.

"Next year, it will tug the debris field away from the Earth, and we won't see a meteor shower, so this is kind of a one-shot deal," Cooke said.

The debris field derives from the coming comet, which bears the uninspiring name 209P/LINEAR.

Astronomers have stopped coming up with fancy nomenclature for the hundreds of comets they spot and instead give each new one a number and the name of the project that discovered it.

Jupiter will fling the comet our way, too, causing it to fly by our planet at a distance of 5 million miles.

"A comfortable distance, which is good," Cooke said. Its core is 1 to 2 miles wide, and a direct hit to Earth would be disastrous.

Even though 209P/LINEAR passes by every five years while orbiting the sun, this time around it will offer a rare sight to hobby astronomers.

"The comet normally doesn't pass this close," Cooke said.

Anyone with a consumer model 3-inch-reflector telescope should be able to see it in the north sky late Wednesday, if the heavens are clear.

Those who want a sneak peek through a more powerful telescope can get it from 6 p.m. ET Saturday via the online observatory service Slooh.

To have 209P/LINEAR's debris field pass the Earth ahead of its comet is like putting the tail before the dog.

Usually debris fields follow comets just like their tails do. Again, Jupiter was the culprit. It ripped off the debris field and threw it out in front of 209P/LINEAR.

"Jupiter is a big gravitational bully of the solar system," Cooke said. This particular comet and its field just happen to pass through that planet's orbit.

After many passes around the solar system, the comet also doesn't have much of a tail left, so gazers shouldn't expect to see a long, stunning ribbon trailing it, just a short dash.

Cooke said from the start that the Camelopardalids could be a star-studded gala or a dud.

NASA couldn't predict it ahead of time, because the debris field was formed some 200 years ago, when astronomers couldn't see it, Cooke said. They merely knew that it was coming.

"It's kind of like being able to predict rain at 11:30 in the morning but not being able to predict a drizzle or a thunderstorm."

Reactions from shooting-star gazers across the country ran the gamut on social media, and judging by some, it did deliver fireworks.

"Izzi and I literally just saw and heard a meteor explode right before our eyes," .hannaH posted to Twitter

"Just saw a awesomely bright meteor with a blue tail!! #MeteorShower," Twitter user Carmen said from Chicago.

But it served up some anticlimax, too. A few netizens called it a complete bust.

CNN iReporter Jean-Francois Gout had only one word to describe the event: "Disappointing."

Gout stayed up for more than seven hours to watch the much anticipated meteor shower from Lake Monroe near Bloomington, Indiana.

Despite the poor showing, Gout still managed to photograph a few passing meteors overhead. But the night was not a complete loss. "It was a great excuse to spend the night out in a remote area with some good friends and enjoy the night and the first fireflies of the season, which sometimes we would think for a fraction of a second were meteors," he said.

Despite the lackluster showing, iReporter Cat Connor enjoyed staying up to watch the celestial event.

She photographed the meteor shower over Mono Lake in California, and she wasn't alone. There were dozens of other photographers camped out at the lake hoping to catch a glimpse of Camelopardalids. "There were many photographers there. All you could see were the lights of their cameras scattered around the lake," she wrote.

"Guess anyone who invited someone on a date to watch the 'meteor shower' is looking like a pretty big creep right about now," New Yorker Kevin Depew tweeted.

Some found moments of serendipity in the event.

Barry Shupp, a Pennsylvania astrophotographer and iReporter, wrote that he was shooting time exposures for the meteor shower when he noticed the International Space Station "creeping along the horizon."

"Quickly setting up a shot, I also captured a meteor in the upper right of photo," he said.

A tweet from Los Angeles Times reporter Deborah Netburn seemed to sum up neatly reactions to the shower.

"Watched the #Camelopardalids from the Eastern Sierras. Not exactly a meteor storm, but the 3 I saw were so cool. Long streaks across the sky."

<text>
KEESEVILLE, N.Y. - A New York man won $3 million from the Lucky $100 Million Payout scratch-off lottery game.

A press release says Douglas Smith, 53, of Wilmington, N.Y., bought the ticket from McLean's Family Restaurant on Route 9 in Keeseville.

I went to the check-out counter and decided to buy two of the same tickets just on impulse, Smith said.

Smith scratched both of the scratch-off tickets on the spot and saw a match. Smith said he took the ticket to another lottery retailer to confirm his winnings. The clerk scanned it and said he was a big winner.

A press release says Smith's winnings marks the fifth time a lottery player from Essex County, New York won the jackpot prize of $1 million or more.

Smith opted to receive his jackpot prize in one lump sum payment totaling $2,270,000 (net $1,502,286). His plans for the money include saving for the future.</text>

<title>India's Narendra Modi: Foreign policy game changer?</title>
<text>
Editor's note: Ravi Agrawal is CNN's New Delhi Bureau chief and was formerly senior producer of the network's "Fareed Zakaria GPS." Follow him on Twitter: @RaviAgrawalCNN. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.

New Delhi (CNN) -- Indians want their version of the American Dream. Even the Chinese Dream will do. And so they have voted for a man who promises more for less: more development and growth, with less government and red tape.

For India's 1.27 billion dreamers, their new Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a known commodity. His simple mandate is to do for India what he has done for the north western state of Gujarat in the last 12 years: conjure up Chinese-levels of growth and prosperity.

But for Modi's counterparts in Washington, Beijing, and Islamabad, India's new leader is considered a wildcard. Will he be aggressive, or a dove? What is his foreign policy? Does he have a vision for India's place in the world?

There's very little to go on. Modi has never addressed foreign policy at length; Indian campaigns rarely involve debates on world affairs. Few in New Delhi seem to have a clear sense of his plans. When I spoke with Arun Shourie, a former Indian minister now being touted as a top candidate to head the finance ministry, I got a telling response: "Anyone who says they know Modi's plans, doesn't really know anything. The ones who know won't talk."

So let's start with the few signals we've received from the man himself.

Modi has certainly begun with a flourish, scoring a coup in getting his Pakistani counterpart to attend his swearing-in.

On Monday, Nawaz Sharif became the first Pakistani Prime Minister in history to attend an Indian prime minister's inauguration.

The two men were photographed exchanging a firm handshake. Modi later tweeted that Sharif had "shared some very emotional things" during their meeting. He elaborated with a story about how Sharif's mother became emotional when watching Modi's mother offering him sweets. (Read the series of tweets here)

Modi's Twitter account also highlights his early attempts to strengthen ties with his new counterparts. After his election, he announced to his 4.38 million followers congratulatory messages from U.S. President Barack Obama, Israel's PM Netanyahu, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, France's Hollande, Russia's Putin, as well as leaders from New Zealand, Fiji, Qatar, Afghanistan and more.

Japan got an especially lavish mention: "Personally, I have a wonderful experience of working with Japan as [Chief Minister of Gujarat.]," Modi tweeted. "I am sure we will take India-Japan ties to newer heights." Japan's PM Shinzo Abe follows only three people on Twitter -- Modi, of course, is one of them.

Twitter diplomacy is not just about rhetoric -- there have been some early results, too. Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse tweeted Sunday: "As a goodwill measure on the occasion of @narendramodi's swearing-in, President instructs officials to release Indian fishermen in custody."

None of the above sheds light on what kind of vision Modi has, but it is indeed a refreshing marker of proactive engagement -- the opposite of India's foreign policy in years gone by. In an excellent essay in Foreign Affairs last month, Manjari Chatterjee Miller described how Indian foreign policy in the last 50 years has been characterized "more by continuity than by change" -- irrespective of the party in power.

India's relations with major powers have stayed stable. Broadly, there are two reasons behind this trend. One is India's historic pledge of "non-alignment": the country's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru founded the global Non-Aligned Movement, a group of states agreeing to not align with major powers. The other reason is India's neglect of foreign policy planning from the very top: civil servants get little-to-no instruction from the prime minister's office, and so have great levels of autonomy and wield significant power. The result is no clear vision from New Delhi, and a general stasis in India's relations with the world. It has often been pointed out that India has fewer diplomats than Singapore, a country with a population 1/250th the size of India's. India has consistently punched below its weight despite aspiring to be a global player.

Will Modi change these trends? Again, it is difficult to read his mind. But turn again to what Modi has actually said. The writer Dhruva Jaishanker points out that Modi has repeatedly stated that foreign policy begins at home. This is not to suggest that Modi will be insular. Instead, his relations with other countries will be driven by business needs and a sense of realism -- perhaps similar, in theory, to China's relations with South Asian and African states.

Many writers and commentators have expressed fears about Modi's foreign policy on two main fronts. First, that he will channel his brand of pro-Hindu nationalism into friction with Pakistan. Second, that he will use his prior history with Washington -- Modi's U.S. visa was revoked in 2005 over a never-before-used religious freedoms act -- as a reason to snub the world's biggest economy. On both fronts, we have no way of confirming those fears just yet. But with each passing day, we are witnessing an evolving Modi, a realist whose goal is to grow India Inc. and do business with anyone -- at home or abroad -- who can help achieve that goal.

Modi's real test will be whether he can bring a longer-term vision to India's foreign policy planning. Will he keep New Delhi non-aligned? Will he pivot further East? Will he help fulfil Obama's prediction that India and the U.S. will form the 21st century's defining partnership?

Only Modi knows the answers. But if Indian foreign policy has so far not been driven by the prime minister's office, I think we can now expect that strange quirk to change. For better or worse, Prime Minister Modi will take charge.</text>

<title>Cannes scandals: 5 most controversial film festival moments</title>
<text>
(CNN) -- Cannes has been a hotbed of controversy since the beginning. The first festival, organized by the French in 1939 as a response to the Venice Film Festival -- then a vehicle for Nazi propaganda movies -- had to be canceled after it launched on the day WWII broke out.

The festival returned in 1946 and has since been a fertile ground for taboo-breaking films, wannabes disrobing for a shot at fame, public spats between directors and critics and publicity stunts gone wrong.

The latest rumpus surrounds "Grace of Monaco," a biopic of Grace Kelly, the Oscar-winning American actress who subsequently became the princess of Monaco.

The film has been criticized by the Monaco royal family who said it contains "major historical untruths and a series of purely fictional scenes." The festival would not comment on whether Prince Albert and his sisters, Caroline and Stphanie would attend the gala premiere.

Altercations, scandals and stunts are arguably as much the lifeblood of Cannes as the films and here, in no particular order, are some of the greatest.

Read: Why does Cannes still matter?

Publicity-hungry starlet Simone Silva took her top off during a photo shoot with Hollywood star Robert Mitchum and briefly made global headlines during an infamous incident at the 1954 festival.

The British B-movie actress and glamor model turned up on the Croisette looking for exposure and was quickly crowned "Miss Festival" by organizers who set the photo shoot up for her on the beach.

"The photographers got down on their knees to plead with me to take the top off," she was quoted as saying in Ohio newspaper, The Daily Reporter.

She did, removing her flimsy scarf top and cuddling up to Robert Mitchum, in just a grass skirt and covering her breasts with her hands. In the ensuing scrum three photographers fell into the Mediterranean, a fourth broke his ankle and another suffered a fractured elbow.

Silva left the festival a few days later, after being asked to leave, but remained defiant: "As long as sex is box office and I keep my figure, I'm out to be the sexiest thing on, oh, two legs."

There are some things you just know are a bad idea, right? Apparently not if you are the upstart cast of a hot Brit-flick.

In 2001, actors from "24 Hour Party People," which tells the story of the Manchester music scene in the late '80s, attacked each other with dead pigeons on a private Cannes beach splattering diners at an exclusive restaurant with fake blood, feathers and worse.

Security guards threatened the actors with mace and they were unceremoniously ejected from the beach along with the film crew and entourage of British journalists who had been watching gleefully.

Actor Danny Cunningham, who played Shaun Ryder the wild lead singer of Manchester indie band Happy Mondays came up with the ill-judged publicity stunt. He said it was inspired by an alleged incident from Ryder's youth shown in the film where he poisoned 3,000 Manchester pigeons with crack cocaine. The actors brought stuffed pigeons as props for the stunt.

Cunningham, who received a cut to the head in the scuffle, told the BBC: "I think Shaun would have been proud of us. We came to Cannes to be wild and now we are going home."

New Wave on the beach

It was May 1968 and revolution was in the air. Students were marching in the streets and workers were participating in the biggest strike France has ever seen. It was, perhaps, inevitable that some of that fever would infiltrate the rarefied movie theaters of Cannes.

Politics burst into the festival when a group of filmmakers led by New Wave directors Jean-Luc Godard and Francois Truffaut demanded it close in solidarity with the strikes.

"We're talking solidarity with students and workers and you are talking dolly shots and close-ups," Godard memorably shouted from behind a pair of Ray-Bans. "You're assholes!"

Godard and Truffaut stopped the next screening by hanging off the curtain as it was being pulled back and the festival was canceled shortly after, five days before its scheduled end. No prizes were handed out.

Over the next few years, counterculture also invaded the content of the festival with films like "Easy Rider" and "M*A*S*H."

When cult film director and actor Vincent Gallo turned up to Cannes in 2003 with "The Brown Bunny," an incoherent road movie with a graphic, unsimulated oral sex scene, the critics booed in boredom and disgust and Roger Ebert called it "the worst film in the history of the festival."

A humiliated Gallo returned to the U.S. and began a new edit of the film but found the time to embark on a vicious war of words with Ebert, calling him "a fat pig," who "had the physique of a slave trader," topping it off by putting a hex on his colon and saying he hoped he got cancer.

Ebert retorted, tartly: "I had a colonoscopy once, and they let me watch it on TV. It was more entertaining than "The Brown Bunny."

And added, in a twist on late UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill's immortal line: "It is true that I am fat, but one day I will be thin, and he will still be the director of 'The Brown Bunny.'"

Amazingly, the spat ended in a truce. Gallo finished his re-edit and showed "The Brown Bunny" at Toronto where Ebert saw it again, this time awarding it three out of a possible four stars.

In 2011, famously eccentric Danish director Lars von Trier told onlookers at a press conference that he was a Nazi, that he understood Hitler and that his next film could be The Final Solution.

"I understand Hitler. I think he did some wrong things, yes absolutely, but I can see him sitting in his bunker in the end. I think I understand the man," said Von Trier while Kirsten Dunst and Charlotte Gainsbourg, stars of his sci-fi drama "Melancholia," looked on in helpless disbelief.

"How do I get out of this? Ok, I'm a Nazi," he added shortly after in what could kindly be described as an ill-judged joke. Festival officials condemned his statements, which he retracted shortly after, but officials still took unusual step of banning him from the festival.

Von Trier has been a one-man scandal factory since he started showing films at Cannes in the '80s. Incensed at being passed over for the top prize in 1991, he called Jury President Roman Polanski a "midget," while Icelandic musician Bjork, who won Best Actress for her starring role in his 2000 film "Dancer in the Dark" said she would never act again.

But perhaps his greatest scandal (apart from the Nazi joke) was in 2009 when there were reports that some audience members fainted from shock after watching a scene in his grotesque art-horror "Antichrist" in which Charlotte Gainsbourg mutilates her genitals. The ecumenical jury at Cannes called it "misogynistic" and awarded it a special anti-prize.</text>

<title>Robin Thicke is still trying to get Paula Patton back</title>
<text>
(CNN) -- Robin Thicke isn't giving up on his marriage to Paula Patton.

The couple, married since 2005, mutually decided to separate in February, and since then singer Thicke has been trying to win her back with his performances.

It was speculated that Thicke might try such a gesture during his set at the Billboard Music Awards on Sunday. Sure enough, the R&B crooner appeared to make a not-so-veiled reference to his romantic life with a performance of "Get Her Back" during the ceremony.

The new single has lyrics such as "all I want to do is make it right" and, "I miss you, I miss you so much, baby/I just want you to come back home."

While Thicke never mentioned Patton by name during the performance, he did thank his "wife" for "her love and support and for putting up with me all these years" during an acceptance speech for Top R&B song.

That also wouldn't be the first time Thicke's tried such a maneuver. Not long after the couple announced their separation,Thicke took the stage in Virginia and dedicated his hit "Lost Without You" to his wife. "I'm trying to get my girl back," he told the crowd. "She's a good woman."

According to People magazine, Thicke's taking his tour of love to Tuesday night's "The Voice" finale as well.

Patton, for her part, has been somewhat more demure about the couple's status.

When Vanity Fair wanted to know if her relationship with Thicke had reached its end, the actress vaguely replied, "We've known each other since we were teenagers. All I can tell you is there's a deep love there -- always was, and always will be."</text>

<title>Dakar Biennale brings modern African art to the world stage</title>
<text>
(CNN) -- The march music stops and the camera screens come to life as 70 small black cannons fire a shower of golden confetti high above the crowds. Tumbling through the air, the shiny plume swirls in a fleeting dance, covering the ground in a sprawling blanket of gold stars.

It was with this rain of 54,000 star-shaped gold confetti, part of his "Celebration" installation, that Algerian artist Slimane Rais chose to mark the opening of the 11th edition of the Dakar Biennale of Contemporary African Art (Dak'Art) on May 10.

The month-long event is Africa's major contemporary art stage. Its main exhibition, housed on an industrial wasteland on the southeastern edge of the bustling Senegalese capital, has brought together 61 well-established and emerging artists from all across the continent and the African diaspora.

Across three old warehouses, a diverse array of paintings, sculptures, videos, installations and mixed-media work leads audiences into an immersive journey of forms and ideas that seeks to go beyond aesthetics.

"We are in an era where art should speak for something," says Ugochukwu-Smooth Nzewi, one of the Biennale's three curators. "There's a crisis in Nigeria for example with Boko Haram -- you expect artists to respond to that because artists act as seers of society," he adds. "[To] engage with the real issues of our time, like inequality or social conditions, without the work losing the sublime quality that makes art art -- it's very important."

True, shortcomings such as last-minute schedule changes and repairs, as well as missing work (the area supposed to host the etching prints of Julie Mehretu, the world-renowned Ethiopian artist and one of Dak'Art's biggest names, was left glaringly empty at the time of the opening) took some shine off this year's opening event, but also added a real sense of adventure. Yet, this is still a powerful showcase, with several highlights reaffirming the renewed energy of Africa's contemporary artists and their growing relevance in the global stage.

One of them is "The End of Eating Everything," a captivating video installation by Wangechi Mutu. In a small darkened room, the Kenyan artist uses a Medusa-like creature that obsessively devours everything around her to paint a grim picture of today's mass consumerism. Likewise, Cameroonian Justine Gaga deploys giant anthropomorphic gas canisters in "Indignation" to denounce issues like fundamentalism, racism and corruption and to call for resistance.

In "Corps en Resonance," Tunisian Naziha Mestaoui invites visitors to interact with three crystal bowls filled with water to produce hypnotizing sounds and eerie light reflections. This is a crowd-pleaser, just like the intriguing work by Kenya-based Sam Hopkins, who playfully mixes real and imaginary NGO logos to question the role and motivations of charity groups. Similarly, Angolan Kiluanji Kia Henda imagines an African NGO that gives grants to Western countries in a series of manipulated images that challenge assumptions over international aid.

All the exhibited work has been brought together under the central theme of "Producing the Common," an ambitious attempt to showcase art that engages with the real issues of today. Or, as the biennial's three curators -- Nzewi, Elise Atangana and Abdelkader Damani -- put it, "to connect politics and aesthetics in a vigorous and sustained way."

A more tangible link, however, is that all participating artists are exhibiting in Dakar for the first time. "The real value of Dak'Art is that it serves as a platform of visibility for African artists, so it makes no sense if you keep on repeating the same set of people over the different iterations," says Nzewi. "In a way, with this edition we are set to reposition Dak'Art going forward."

One of these newcomers is Milumbe Haimbe, a Zambian artist exploring the representation of cultural minorities in popular media. Here, she uses comic book illustrations to challenge the stereotypical portrayal of women in contemporary graphic novels, as well as the absence of female black superheroes in the genre.

"My protagonist in this particular comic is female, black, young and gay," says Haimbe, introducing "Ananiya," an undercover agent operating in a not-too-distant future, where the whole world is controlled by a powerful corporation.

"The idea is to help different people to relate to different symbolisms," says Haimbe. "A lot of the heroes in popular media, whether they are comics, movies or novels, are heterosexual white males -- nothing wrong with that but I think we need to see another alternative," she adds. "You know, the world is made out of so many people."

Like other art festivals, Dak'art gives out awards to participating artists. Haimbe herself was one of the 10 winners, scooping the "Prix de la Fondation Blachere." The grand prize was shared by Algerian artist Driss Ouadahi, for his "Unter Uns" painting, and Nigerian Olu Amoda, for his "Sunflower" sculpture, a compelling creation made of repurposed nails and spoons in Lagos's junkyards.

"The sunflower comprises of several small flowers and when they come together they glow under the sun," says Amoda. "So I'm trying to look at the positive signs of the interdependence of Africans ... because the interpretation of Africa is such that it's conflict and famine."

Dak'Art first appeared in the calendars of art aficionados in the early 1990s, initially as an event dedicated to literature and then as a biennial of visual arts that welcomed artists from all over the world. By 1996, however, at a time when few young African artists were able to break into the international market, Dak'Art had already found a new focus as a pan-African contemporary art biennial.

The transformation helped it distinguish itself from other large-scale recurring exhibitions but also connected it to a longer history of 20th century black consciousness, where Senegal played a leading role -- it's hard to start talking today about Dak'Art without the name of Leopold Sedar Senghor, Senegal's first president, popping up. A poet, writer and an avid art collector himself, Senghor famously staged the first World Festival of Black Arts in Dakar in 1966, bringing together artists, dancers, writers and musicians from all over Africa, Europe, North and South America and the Caribbean.

Today, as more and more African artists are finally making a name outside the continent, Dak'Art has become the main platform for Africa and its diaspora to engage with the international market, attracting the usual crowds of artists, curators, critics and art historians.

Similar to previous editions, this year's biennial doesn't start and end with its five main events. Even though the local public here seems to be largely unaware of them, there are some 200 parallel exhibitions running simultaneously across and outside Dakar, giving the opportunity to 500 artists to showcase their work in a wide array of spaces ranging from art galleries and hotel lobbies to bookstores and restaurants.

Back in the main exhibition, curator Abdelkader Damani walks past the massive installations dotting the outdoor space, stopping every now and then to hug and talk to artists crossing his path. He says part of Dak'Art's goals this year were to help launch the careers of unknown artists and also help deal with the absence of an active market for contemporary art in the continent.

"There's just one problem with the African art in the continent: there are no local markets for this kind of art," he says. "There are not that many institutions who help," he adds.

"Artists need to go to Europe or America to find someone who can buy the work and help and do the exhibitions," continues Damani. "I know that what we are doing here is going to open this way to make all the people in Africa understand that."</text>

<title>Does the French Open need an invincible Rafael Nadal?  CNN World Sport</title>
<text>
Its an audacious question to ask of someone whos just made back-to-back finals, and who is, not to mention, the world's top-ranked men's tennis player.

And yet, many people are asking just that.

The reason is simple. Our expectations for Rafa on clay dont merely begin and end with winning. We expect complete and utter domination. We expect perfection.

And for the last nine years, the "King of Clay" has delivered exactly that.

However, over the last few months, Nadal has shown the merest hint of vulnerability on the " terre battue." A sight hereto unseen since he exploded onto the ATP Tour back in 2005.

In Madrid, Japanese up-and-comer Kei Nishikori had the Spaniardwith his back against the ropes until the newly-minted world top-10 player ran out of steam and retired in the decider with a back problem. In Rome, Rafa was taken the distance in the first three rounds before finally succumbing to Novak Djokovic in the final.

An impressive run by normal standards, but Rafa is not a normal clay-court player.

In nine years at the French Open, he has claimed a staggering eight titles, winning over 98% of his matches, having been pushed to five sets just twice in 60 outings. The only year he didn't win it, 2009, he lost to eventual runner-up Robin Soderling in round four.

On clay, hes expected to win. And win big. Always.

But not this year.

The upside is that for the first time in almost a decade, we are looking at a genuinely wide open grand slam tournament, starting Sunday.

But is this necessarily a good thing?

Granted, watching Nadal dominate for so long was starting to get predictable, and the certainty of the end result did render the excitement of the event somewhat impotent.

But this year it isnt only Rafa whos looking less than himself on the red stuff.

Djokovics form in Rome was impressive, but with his recent wrist injuries and the devastating floods in his home Serbiaweighing heavily on his mind, the world No. 2is no sure bet to make it to the latter stages.

Roger Federer has only played one match since his third and fourth child were born earlier this month: an uncharacteristic loss to 47th-ranked Jeremy Chardy of France. One would imagine rest is difficult with four young children, and he may struggle to add to that sole Roland Garros title from 2009 and extend his record tally of 17 grand slam crowns.

Andy Murray has had injury troubles plague his entire season and has struggled to put together back-to-back wins since splitting with his coach Ivan Lendl back in March, and last years runner-up David Ferrer hasnt exactly been lighting up the red dirt this spring either despite beating Nadal in Monte Carlo.

The most impressive player on the clay so far has been Nishikori. After winning the title in Barcelona, in Madrid he ran through ninth-rankedMilos Raonic and three Spaniards, including Ferrer, before eventually fading away against Nadal in the final. For a brief moment it seemed as though 24-year-old would not only beat the world No. 1, but completely dismantle him.

So, if Nishikori can get through the first few rounds with his lungs intact, you could be looking at a brand new grand slam champion.

But is that really what you want?

To many diehard fans of the game, the prospect of a Nishikori-Grigor Dimitrov final is exciting, novel and refreshing.

But for those who tune in four times a year to see the best players thrash it out at the grand slams, they want to see the very best players in the world. Or, has been the case at the French Open for so long, the very best player in the world, destroying the best players in the world as though they were club hackers.

So, what is wrong with Rafa Nadal?

Wheres the impenetrable wall of defense, the incredible turn of speed, the unfathomable production of topspin?

True, predictable results are boring, and Cinderella stories are exciting. But seeing the greatest clay-court player of all time, exhibiting ever-increasing levels of perfection is perhaps the most exciting thing of all.

<title>Army of robots to invade Amazon warehouses</title>
<text>
CEO Jeff Bezos told investors at a shareholder meeting Wednesday that he expects to significantly increase the number of robots used to fulfill customer orders.

There are currently about 1,000 robot workers on Amazon floors. The increase won't change the number of actual people employed, an Amazon spokeswoman said.

The robots are made by Kiva Systems, a company Amazon bought for $775 million two years ago.

They are tied into a complex grid that requires months of planning and testing. But once the system is in place, it can save time and cut down on fulfillment costs.

While robots are playing a growing role in fulfilling orders in the warehouse, it could still be years before Amazon sends packages via drones to customers' homes. Bezos plans to have drones deliver packages to your door in 30 minutes, but there are a number of legal and technological hurdles before that can happen.

For now, you'll have to visit the warehouses to see a robot helping to deliver your package. Amazon ( Fortune 500) started offering public tours this month.</text>

<title>Opinion: What India can learn from China</title>
<text>
Editor's note: Ravi Agrawal is CNN's New Delhi Bureau chief and was formerly senior producer of the network's "Fareed Zakaria GPS." Follow him on Twitter: @RaviAgrawalCNN

Hong Kong (CNN) -- I met an entrepreneur recently who was comparing doing business in Asia's two biggest countries. "When I'm in India," he said, "I spend the first 40 minutes of any meeting exchanging niceties. In the last five minutes, we get to business." What about China? "We do business for 40 minutes. Right at the end, we chit-chat for five."

It's only an anecdote, but the results seem to bear it out. China gets things done; India invents ways not to. China dazzles the world by hosting an impeccable Olympics; India struggles to complete basic infrastructure for the Commonwealth Games.

Perhaps that's why it's fascinating to watch the rise of India's Narendra Modi, the man many believe will be India's next Prime Minister. Modi's sales pitch is simple: he gets things done. For Indians, it's a seductive notion: Can India be like China?

There is no doubt that India has room to improve. Consider productivity: India's ranks 60th in the world on the World Economic Forum's ranking of countries by competitiveness (China is 29th). Or consider ease of doing business: the World Bank ranks India 134th in the world. If you want to start a business, the World Bank says India ranks 179th in the world -- in other words, go ahead and explore opportunities in 178 other countries before you settle on India. It's as good as putting a "closed" sign on the shop door.

For businesses in India and beyond, Modi represents an end to red tape. India's financial markets are salivating at the prospect of his leadership -- stocks are up 20% since his candidacy was announced last September.

If you speak to voters in his home state of Gujarat -- which has flourished with Chinese levels of growth under his leadership in the last decade -- Modi represents the joys of getting rich. Sounds familiar? That's because it evokes Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese premier who kick-started national reforms and an unprecedented period of growth.

It's not just Deng. Modi has been compared to a number of world leaders. Some say he would be like Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's visionary leader. (Note that implicit in these comparisons is the understanding that Modi could tend toward being authoritarian).

Others say the best person to compare Modi to is U.S. President Ronald Reagan -- because both were outsiders resented by traditional elites. Still others insist the best analogy is former British PM Margaret Thatcher, because of their shared appetite for privatization and small government.

Modi could be any -- or none -- of those leaders. The truth is we just don't know; we don't have enough information about his track record, and how it could translate across India. But the larger point is that this is not just about Modi, it's about India.

The Carnegie Endowment's Milan Vaishnav rightly points out that even the most reform-minded prime minister would face many hurdles. Among them, Vaishnav cites a J.P. Morgan study of 50 of the central government's stalled investment projects: 40 of them fell through because of state, and not central, red tape. Constitutionally, there's little a prime minister can do about that, no matter how reform-minded.

Let me use another anecdote to explain the task ahead for the world's biggest democracy. Indians are infamous for being unpunctual. So, one wonders, is that genetic? Are Indians inherently prone to being late to meetings? The answer is no. Take an Indian who is unpunctual, and place him in New York -- he'll likely be on time for every meeting he schedules.

Similarly, a New Yorker would likely become unpunctual in New Delhi. The reason is that punctuality is based on economic incentive -- if everyone is always on time, then it makes sense to make an effort to be on time. It follows then, punctuality is based on inertia. If everyone's doing it, it's in your best interest to follow suit.

In a free democracy like India, progress is based on inertia, too. Everyone needs to push at the same time. Indians can dream to have cities like Singapore, Hong Kong or Beijing. But to do so they will need more than just one reform-minded leader. They will need change from the bottom up.

For better or worse, such is the nature of India's secular, constitutional democracy. India can certainly learn from China. But to do that, it doesn't have to become China. In the next few weeks and months, that is the issue Indians will be debating.</text>

<title>Gas attack alleged in Syria; 21 die in shelling</title>
<text>
(CNN) -- After another violent week in Syria's civil war, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed regrets for the "inability of the international community to unite in stopping this conflict."

Ban was referring to a mortar attack Friday on an electoral rally that reportedly killed at least 21 people.

A child was among the dead in the shelling, which struck a pro-government election campaign tent in the regime-controlled part of Daraa.

The opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that Islamist rebels were responsible for the attack and that at least 11 of the victims were civilians.

The United Nations has asked the Syrian government to reconsider next month's election as the carnage mounts. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who is blamed for the using his military to clamp down on opposition forces, is once again a candidate.

The observatory estimates that more than 160,000 lives have been lost in the conflict.

"The Syrian people desperately need an end to violence and a clean break from the past to move toward a new Syria, one in which their legitimate aspirations are met and all communities are protected," said a representative for Ban.

But the latest reports from the ground do not show signs of a slowdown in violence.

Syrian troops lobbed shells laced with chlorine at a western Syrian town on Thursday, causing dozens to suffer from the inhalation of toxic gas, the opposition-run Hama Media Center said.

A dramatic video posted on social media by activists purportedly shows yellow gas hanging in a narrow street at dusk in Kafr Zeita.

A young man in a gas mask runs into the cloud of smoke and walks out moments later with a woman trying to cover her mouth as she struggles to breathe.

Another video shows children choking and women using oxygen masks at a makeshift clinic. A man in scrubs turns to the camera while treating the victims and says, "This is a chlorine gas attack."

Kafr Zeita.is the same opposition-held location where the United States and its allies believe al-Assad's government used the toxic gas in an April 11 attack.

CNN cannot independently confirm the authenticity of the videos.

Also Thursday, the Syrian government wrested control of the Central Prison in Aleppo, breaking a 13-month rebel siege on the sprawling complex where dozens of political prisoners are believed to be held, according to opposition groups and Syrian state media.

Since a 2012 prison revolt, detainees suffered from lack of food, inadequate medical care and the spread of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and dysentery, the Violations Documentation Center, a local monitoring group, found in a report published in April.

More than 650 prisoners died either due to deteriorating conditions or at the hands of jailers, whom the center alleges carried out torture and summary executions.</text>

<title>Opinion: Negotiation, not force, way to #BringBackOurGirls</title>
<text>
Editor's note: Shehu Sani is a Nigerian civil rights activist, playwright and author. He is president of the Civil Rights Congress of Nigeria and has negotiated with Boko Haram in the past. Follow @shehusani on Twitter. The views expressed in this commentary are solely the author's.

(CNN) -- Until the abduction of more than 200 girls at the Government Girls Secondary School in rural Chibok, Nigeria's Boko Haram insurgency received scant attention in the global media, which gave it brief airtime when the insurgents exploded their bombs or torched a school.

However, the mass abduction has brought the world's attention to the callous and unceasing violence that has become routine in northern Nigeria over the last three years.

The area has suffered more than three decades of religious violence between Muslims and Christians.

But since Boko Haram founder Mohammed Yusuf was killed in a 2009 security crackdown -- along with hundreds of his followers -- the militant Islamist group has stepped up its attacks.

Boko Haram militants have killed clerics, bombed churches and mosques and assassinated politicians and government officials.

When the militants attack churches, their aim is to start a sectarian war that will engulf the country; when they attack mosques, their aim is to exterminate Muslims they consider collaborators.

In the last three years, the Nigerian Government has opted for the use of force to exterminate the insurgents, rather than diminish the activities of the group -- and it has become more daring and audacious in its attacks.

Despite the allocation of 25% of the annual budget to defense and security, the government has been unable to crush and contain the insurgency. The group has taken on and demoralized the rank and file of the Nigerian army and police.

Boko Haram has launched deadly raids on military garrisons and police and secret intelligence offices to free their detained members. The use of force against the group has only led to allegations of a chain of rights abuses with the justification that it is a war on terror.

Nigeria's Human Rights Commission last year accused the military of arbitrary killings, torture and rape in its campaign, while the military has described reports of civilian casualties as "grossly exaggerated."

Our constitutional freedom has been formally suppressed by the authorities on the grounds of national emergency. The strategy of collective punishment, arbitrary arrests, prolonged detention and killing raids by the security forces has alienated the civil populace and turned them into victims. In the war against Boko Haram, civilians have become victims of both the military and the militants.

I mooted the idea of dialogue with the insurgents as a new option towards ending the insurgency and restoring peace to my bewildered and beleaguered nation. In September 2011, I facilitated talks with the insurgents and the former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo -- then chairman of Nigeria's ruling party.

The first surprise in the encounter was that the representatives of the terror group spoke fluent English. The bigger surprise was when some of the insurgents revealed that they had university degrees. It is a prerequisite for new Boko Haram members to burn their university certificates or any paper identification that links them secular schools.

In the meeting, they justified their violence on the grounds that it was the Nigerian Government that had forced them to take up arms. They said that before they trod the path of violence, they first tried to take the path of peace.

They even showed us copies of a petition they wrote to the government complaining about the harassment and intimidation of their sect members by security forces before they picked up arms.

They showed us photographs of followers and relatives they said had been killed by the police in cold blood, even before the insurgency began and threatened more attacks until they "avenge the injustices done to them."

They expressed anger at the way people criticized and condemned them when they launched attacks but kept mute when Boko Haram members were killed, their homes demolished and their wives and children arrested by the security forces.

We took their grievances to the government and advised the government to follow through, but hawks within the corridors of power discouraged the president from taking our advice.

The second effort at dialogue involved a northern Islamic cleric and head of the Nigeria sharia council. The talks were facilitated by a freelance journalist who was later threatened by those opposed to dialogue.

This second round of dialogue took place in the last quarter of 2012.

Boko Haram accused the government of leaking the details of the talks to the media for political reasons. One of the group's conditions for talks had been that only their outcome be made public.

We were close to achieving a ceasefire but again hawks, security and defense contractors in the corridors of power sabotaged our efforts.

I have never met the Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau but I declined to meet him on two occasions when I got his invitation to interview him. I declined because I realized that the government was not interested in my approach.

The abduction of the girls in Chibok is one of many abductions over the last three years.

If the Nigerian authorities took lessons from earlier attacks on schools by the insurgents, the Chibok abductions couldn't have happened. The Chibok abduction was a preventable and avoidable tragedy.

When the militants abduct boys, they use them as conscripts and girls as cooks and hostages. I cannot confirm if they used abducted girls as sex slaves -- the leadership of the group denied such reports when we asked them, but abducted women who were later freed give credence to such claims.

Each day the Chibok girls spend in captivity keeps the moral flag of my country at half mast.

The #BringBackOurGirls protest and the interest shown by President Obama and other world leaders and celebrities like Alicia Keys and Angelina Jolie has kept the spirits of Chibok mothers high and the Nigerian Government on its toes.

When we were children, we used to forecast that one day the Sambisa forest in Borno state would become a game reserve which would attract foreign tourists and foreign currencies. Today it is attracting foreign interest for negative reasons.

The Chibok girls must be freed but not by the use of force except when other options fail. The schoolgirls are now innocent hostages in the hands of soulless gunmen.

We don't want the body of the girls to be brought back home, we want them back home alive.

The use of force could turn out to be tragic. Experience has shown that attempts in the past to free hostages from the insurgents through the use of force has deadly consequences.

French hostages were freed in Nigeria through negotiations but a British and Italian hostage were killed in Sokoto when UK forces went to free them.

We can get the Chibok girls back home and we must.

I was delighted to learn that the special team sent by the U.S. and UK also included experts in hostage negotiation. I strongly believe that Islamic clerics in northern Nigeria and some of the top ranking insurgents currently in detention can be used to open a channel of communication with the leadership of the sect in order to secure the release of the Chibok girls.

There are those who say that the option of negotiating to free the hostages will embolden the terrorists, I have never been a hostage but I have been a political prisoner who spent many years in prison during our struggle against military dictatorship in Nigeria in the 1990s.

Those who experience captivity appreciate freedom the most.

The situation we find ourselves in is a tough moment in our history, but I believe we shall overcome it.

Many Nigerians believe that the way the Chibok issue is resolved will determine the political future of Nigeria.

<title>Ukraine billionaire Petro Poroshenko leads in early election results</title>
<text>
Donetsk, Ukraine (CNN) -- Billionaire Petro Poroshenko leads all candidates with 54% of the vote counted in Ukraine's presidential election, the Central Elections Commission reported Monday.

He declared victory a day earlier, following preliminary exit polls that suggested he had secured a majority of the vote.

His closest challenger, Yulia Tymoshenko, a former Ukrainian prime minister and the leader of the Batkivshchyna party, conceded the election after exit polls showed her with 13% of the vote, which matched Monday's early official tally.

Poroshenko, a candy tycoon known as the "Chocolate King," is also a seasoned politician known for his pro-European Union views.

At a news conference in Kiev, he reiterated that European integration would be his priority. He added that in Sunday's vote, the President and the whole of Ukraine had changed.

He said Russia needs to participate in bringing peace to eastern Ukraine.

Voters were picking a successor to the ousted pro-Moscow President, Viktor Yanukovych, in a country torn apart by Russia's takeover of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula and a bloody conflict involving pro-Russia factions.

The unrest has centered in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, where separatists have claimed independence after a disputed referendum this month -- and many there did not get to cast ballots Sunday.

Reports from the region indicated that perhaps 75% of polling stations were closed, according to regional officials.

More violence was reported overnight as authorities suspended flights at Donetsk airport after separatist gunmen stormed the terminal building, airport spokesman Dmitriy Kosinov said Monday. Ukraine military forces moved in by air and on the ground and gunbattles broke out. From the city, smoke could be seen rising from the airport.

Increasing violence in the east has led the authorities in Kiev to accuse Russia, which they say is backing the armed separatists, of seeking to disrupt the vote. Russia denies having direct influence over the militants, and Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he will respect Ukrainians' choice in the election.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov reiterated that stance Monday during a news conference in Moscow.

But Lavrov also said Russia hopes that the new president will put an end to all "extremist activities" in eastern Ukraine and end the anti-terrorist operation in the eastern regions.

A large separatist rally was held in a central Donetsk city square around lunchtime Sunday. The protesters, who chanted pro-Russia slogans as they were addressed by separatist leaders, were joined by a substantial number of militants on trucks, some firing guns into the air.

On the back of some of the trucks were armed men who appeared to be Chechen. Two told a CNN team they were from the Chechen capital, Grozny, and one indicated that he was formerly a policemen in Chechnya and was in Donetsk to serve the Russian Federation.

The men, who as Chechens are Russian citizens, said they were there as "volunteers." But if their accounts were true, their presence in Donetsk would appear to indicate some kind of acquiescence by the Russian government at the least.

Residents of Ukraine's southeastern city of Mariupol saw new billboards on the streets Sunday urging them not to cast their ballots. The billboards were not at those locations the night before, residents said.

Also in Mariupol, people talked on social media about being asked by local Russia supporters to boycott the election. The city is one of several where deadly clashes have erupted in recent weeks.

The self-declared mayor of rebel stronghold Slovyansk, Vyacheslav Ponomaryov, has said that anyone who tried to vote there would be arrested.

Also, an Italian journalist was killed Saturday near the flashpoint town, the Italian Foreign Ministry announced Sunday. The man, named as Andrea Rocchelli, was killed along with a Russian citizen, the ministry said. Reports suggested there had been mortar fire in the Slovyansk area.

Besides the presidential race, candidates were also running in municipal elections in some cities. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe deployed 900 observers for the election, the largest such mission in its history.

At a news conference Monday, OSCE Parliamentary President Joao Soares said the election was fair and represented the will of the Ukrainian people, despite major problems in two eastern provinces. He said the election sent a message to the pro-Russia militants: "You cannot win by breaking the rules."

"The voting was free, without artificial restrictions and administrative pressure," Turchynov said in a statement.

U.S. President Barack Obama congratulated Ukrainians for casting their ballots Sunday and criticized Russia-backed separatists, whom he accused of trying to block voting.

"Despite provocations and violence, millions of Ukrainians went to the polls throughout the country, and even in parts of eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatist groups sought to disenfranchise entire regions, some courageous Ukrainians still were able to cast their ballots," he said in a written statement.

"We commend the resolve of all those who participated, as well as the efforts of the Ukrainian government to conduct these elections in the face of those threats."

But Russia's Lavrov offered a different view Monday, saying that not all candidates were given an equal opportunity to present themselves to the nation and campaign properly. He said many even faced threats to their lives, and others were assaulted.

Opinion: Free elections good for Ukraine, but could be bad for Putin

<title>Spacey's selfie creates political controversy in Mexico</title>
<text>
(CNN) -- It seemed innocent enough: two famous men running into each other at a public event by coincidence, exchanging pleasantries and small talk, and posing for a selfie later posted on Twitter.

But the meeting between "House of Cards" actor Kevin Spacey and Mexican President Enrique Pea Nieto this month in Cancn is at the center of a political controversy in Mexico that caught both the Hollywood star and Mexican government by surprise.

Spacey, who plays a president on the Netflix series, posted the selfie with the Mexican leader on May 7. "1 President is real. W/Pres Nieto in #Mexico. Good meeting a man also making progress in 1st year in office. @EPN" was the caption on Twitter.

The selfie was taken at Tianguis Turistico, an international tourism conference held in the beach resort of Cancn. Tour operators and tourism entrepreneurs and companies from around the world as well as Mexican officials and celebrities attend the event organized by the Mexican government.

The Mexican President also posted a picture with Spacey on his Twitter account, although it was a more formal, sit-down meeting, with the two men talking and looking at each other.

"It was nice to be with actor @KevinSpacey, special guest of #TianguisTuristico, last night in Cancun," Pea Nieto wrote on his Twitter account May 7.

"To fans of @HouseofCards, I'm sorry, I can't give away details of the third season," the President jokingly wrote later. He also retweeted Spacey's selfie.

Controversy erupted May 12 after Mexican columnist Salvador Garca Soto wrote in the 24 Horas newspaper that Spacey had been paid $8 million by the Mexican federal government. Political analysts immediately started questioning whether the meeting had truly been "a coincidence" or a shameless, self-promotional ploy by the President, paid for by Mexican taxpayers.

Spacey was the first to react to the storm of criticism in Mexico. "Story about Mex Gov paying 8m or any amount for selfie not true! Was In Mex for Tourist Board event. Meeting President not planned at all," Spacey tweeted May 16.

He had earlier tweeted that his endorsement of Pea Nieto was not necessarily personal. "I guess nobody got the joke. I was in character as Francis Underwood in House of Cards, not myself! I don't know jack about Mexican politics," Spacey said.

CNN reached out to Mexican officials for comment. In an e-mail, Rodolfo Lpez Negrete, chief executive officer of the Mexico Tourism Board, said that Spacey was paid to appear at the tourism event but not to pose with the President.

"Kevin Spacey's participation at the Tianguis Turistico was part of the event's general program. The Tianguis is self-financed through the sale of booths and entry fees. We also have sponsors through which tourism service providers finance some costs," Lpez Negrete wrote.

Lpez Negrete didn't specify the amount Spacey was paid for his appearance but said the entire event had a cost of between 40 million and 45 million pesos (almost $3.1 million to $3.5 million).

This and other explanations have done little to silence criticism in Mexico. A reader of 24 Horas, the newspaper that originally reported the payment, cynically asked his fellow Mexicans to pay their taxes.

"Let's not stop in complying with our fiscal obligations," the reader wrote, "so that Pea the Clown can keep on paying his favorite actors. Imbecile. So many children on the streets and families without a job and he's spending Mexico's money in his (expletive) hobbies."</text>

<title>Microsoft: The Surface Pro 3 tablet will replace your laptop</title>
<text>
The company says it has designed the one device consumers need to be productive and consume media. The Surface Pro 3 is a full-powered PC that has tablet-like weight and size.

"This is the tablet that can replace your laptop," said Panos Panay, head of Microsoft's ( Fortune 500) Surface division, at an event in New York. "Today we take the conflict away, and I'm absolutely sure of it."

The Surface Pro 3 comes with a 12-inch screen -- about an inch and a half bigger than its Surface Pro 2 predecessor -- and it weighs less than the smallest Apple ( Fortune 500) MacBook Air. At 9.1 mm, it's 14% thinner than the Surface Pro 2 and the thinnest product with an Intel ( Fortune 500) Core chip on the market. The Surface Pro 3 is roughly the thickness of the iPad 2 -- though it's 18% thicker than the iPad Air.

The tablet PC also got a price reduction. It will start at $799, cheaper than the $999 price point for the Surface Pro 2.

Review: The Surface Pro 3 is a good PC, but it's not an iPad replacement

Microsoft showed off a number of programs designed specifically for the new Surface, including Adobe (

As with previous Surfaces, the device comes with a super-thin keyboard and touchpad mouse, and it works with a stylus pen for freehand note-taking.

Panay noted that 96% of people who own an iPad also own a laptop. But Microsoft has struggled to convince consumers that the Surface is the answer to that problem.

Surface started out as an unmitigated disaster for Microsoft, and the company was forced to write down $900 million worth of inventory due to poor sales a year ago. The Surface has performed better since then, as sales grew by 50% to $500 million last quarter.

Related: Windows 8.1's little changes are a huge improvement

Microsoft was also late to the tablet game, debuting the Surface in late 2012 -- nearly three years after Apple unveiled the iPad.

Though the Surface has gotten mixed reviews, its harshest critic is perhaps Apple CEO Tim Cook. In 2012, Cook joked, "You can converge a toaster and a refrigerator, but you know those things are not going to be probably be pleasing to the user."

"We're not interested in making refrigerators and toasters," said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. "Take the best of the tablet and laptop ... that's the device we wanted to create."</text>

<title>Mounties to check Pamela Anderson's sex abuse allegations</title>
<text>
(CNN) -- Canadian investigators want to talk to actress Pamela Anderson about her recent revelation that she suffered sexual abuse as a child.

Anderson, 46, described several incidents of sex abuse at the launch of her charity, the Pamela Anderson Foundation, at the Cannes Film Festival in France on Friday. The incidents started at age 6, she said, when she was molested by a babysitter.

The former "Baywatch" star grew up in British Columbia before starting her modeling and acting career in the United States.

"Given the nature of the allegations, an investigator with the Ladysmith RCMP is in the process of reaching out to Ms. Anderson to discuss this matter with her directly," Royal Canadian Mounted Police spokesman Darren Lagan said Thursday. "Given the sensitive nature of these allegations, and out of respect for Ms. Anderson's privacy, we will provide no further comment at this time."

Although she had "loving parents," Anderson said she "did not have an easy childhood." She never told her parents about the abuse.

Child sex abuse is a taboo topic for some parents

"I feel now might be the time to reveal some of my most painful memories," she said, according to a transcript posted on her blog.

She recounted being molested between the ages of 6 and 10 by a female babysitter and then being raped when she was 12 by the 25-year-old brother of a friend's boyfriend. The man "decided he would teach me backgammon, which led into a back massage, which led into rape," she said.

Coincidentally, the Cannes event at which she revealed the rape was a backgammon tournament.

"Needless to say, I had a hard time trusting humans," Anderson said. "I just wanted off this Earth."

Although her parents "tried to keep me safe," the "world was not a safe place," she said. Her mother was busy with two waitressing jobs, she said.

Anderson said her love for animals saved her.

"My loyalty remained with the animal kingdom," she said. "I vowed to protect them and only them. I prayed to the whales with my feet in the ocean. My only real friends, till I had children."

Before her acting career took off, Anderson started her career as a Playboy centerfold, appearing on 13 covers of the magazine starting in 1989.</text>

<title>I hired someone with Asperger's -- now what?</title>
<text>
Editor's note: April is National Autism Awareness Month. As an enterprise architect at Myriad Genetics in Salt Lake City, Dave Wellman has worked with and managed employees with Asperger's syndrome, a variant of autism. His story first appeared on CNN iReport.

(CNN) -- Last January after a fresh snowstorm, my 9-year-old son asked me to help him build a snowman. I told him that I would be out to help shortly.

A couple of minutes later he came running back yelling, "Dad, it's melting!"

That got my attention. It was sub-30 outside, so how could a snowman be melting?

I followed him as he ran down the hall to his bedroom. In the middle of his room was a 4-foot tall snowman, melting away.

While I removed the snowman and cleaned the remaining slush and mud, I asked him why he did it. He said, in a very matter-of-fact-tone, "It's cold outside."

My son has Asperger's syndrome. For him, building a snowman in his bedroom because it was cold outside was a logical solution to a problem.

Because of my son, "Aspies" hold a special place in my heart. So whenever I hear someone in my industry talk about hiring an Aspie, I cringe just a little. Because in technology, saying you've hired an Aspie is like code to say that you've hired a machine.

It's true that there are a lot of benefits in hiring someone with Asperger's. Research from Harvard Business School shows the strengths of people with Asperger's and high-functioning autism make them especially well-suited for software development and testing. They have the ability to focus for extended periods. They have very good memories and are often highly intelligent. Their strong analytical skills make them talented at technology work.

I have Asperger's: I am just like you

But there is a lot more to Aspies than their focus, intelligence and determination. Aspies are human. Like anyone else, they have their highs and lows, and their good and bad days.

As a manager, you should understand how to handle the unique opportunities and challenges that come with hiring an Aspie. Here are six things you should know:

Asperger's syndrome is a high-functioning variant of autism. People with Asperger's are often exceptionally intelligent and verbally gifted, but they also can be socially awkward. They can react to stress differently and at times more emotionally than others not on the autism spectrum.

Many people with Asperger's are challenged by large crowds, looking people in the eye and reading common social cues. When talking with an Aspie, don't get offended if they look around or focus on an object in the room instead of looking directly at you. This is a coping skill that most Aspies develop over time. Listen to their words instead of focusing on their body language.

Aspies will question authority. They will never accept "no" for an answer without being told the reason for it. They almost never accept a fact simply because of who it comes from. They will only accept it as fact if the logic proves out.

For this reason, many inexperienced managers shy away from working with an Aspie. Don't. You just need to be prepared to justify your decisions when they'll have a direct impact on your Aspie employee.

Aspies frequently talk at length about small details instead of being brief and to the point. The reason is simple: It's how they see the world. They hold complex mental models that include all those small interlocking details. To them, overlooking the details is ignoring part of the solution.

Be patient with them. It's an Aspie's way of getting it.

I have seen Aspies start reprogramming software in their head well before they get back to their desks and write the first line of code. Aspie testers will instantly see what is wrong with the software because it no longer fits their model.

All this "rewiring" has wonderfully positive results.

It's easy to think that Aspies are less empathetic because of how they can act. They're not. When people are unsure how to respond to a stressful or unfamiliar situation, we can act in strange ways. This goes for Aspies, too.

One the most challenging things for any autistic individual to deal with is the cacophony of emotions that can be triggered by seemingly mundane events. For example, the cancellation of a project may be a relief to most of your team, while an Aspie may see it as people not appreciating their hard work or allowing them to finish the job.

Be patient. Pull them aside beforehand to explain the situation and ask them for their feedback and insight. It will give them a chance to process the idea.

In the most simple of terms: Aspies are blunt to a fault.

Aspies are known for being direct, speaking their mind and being honest and determined. Just be aware that an Aspie is interested primarily in significant contributions to conversation, preferring to avoid "small talk," trivial statements and superficial conversation.

Aspies are not trying to be rude.

There is good reason that Asperger's is called the successful disorder. Their focus and dedication leads many Aspies to great heights. I doubt you could find an entrepreneur who doesn't have a few Aspie behaviors.

Asperger's comes with challenges along with the great opportunities. Don't shy away from Aspies because they have different mannerisms or behaviors. Be aware of them and understand how to respond to them. If you do, you will see Aspies as the invaluable people they are and afford them the respect they deserve.

<title>Robots will replace fast-food workers</title>
<text>
Restaurant industry backers warn that a sharp rise in wages would be counterproductive, increasing the appeal of automation and putting more workers at risk of job loss.

"Faced with a $15 wage mandate, restaurants have to reduce the cost of service," blared an ad in The Wall Street Journal last year from the Employment Policies Institute, which supports corporate interests. "That means fewer entry-level jobs and more automated alternatives -- even in the kitchen."

Other industry observers aren't so definitive, noting that it takes time to introduce new technology and that human interaction has always been a major component of the hospitality business. What's clear at least is that software and machines will play an increased role in our dining experiences going forward.

Panera, which spent $42 million developing its new system, claims it isn't planning any job cuts as a result of the technology, but some analysts see this kind of shift as unavoidable for the industry.

In a widely cited paper released last year, University of Oxford researchers estimated that there is a 92% chance that fast-food preparation and serving will be automated in the coming decades.

With artificial-intelligence technology like IBM's ( Fortune 500) Watson platform making strides in advanced reasoning and language understanding, it's not hard to see how robots could be designed to provide more sophisticated interactions with restaurant customers than kiosks can manage.

Delivery drivers could be replaced en masse by self-driving cars, which are likely to hit the market within a decade or two, or even drones. In food preparation, there are start-ups offering robots for bartending and gourmet hamburger preparation. A food processing company in Spain now uses robots to inspect heads of lettuce on a conveyor belt, throwing out those that don't meet company standards, the Oxford researchers report.

Darren Tristano, a food industry expert with the research firm Technomic, said digital technology will "slowly, over time, create efficiency and labor savings" for restaurants. He guessed that work forces would only drop as a result by 5% or 10% at a maximum in the decades to come, however, given the expectations that customers have for the dining experience.

"If you look at the thousands of years that consumers have been served alcohol and food by people, it's hard to imagine that things will change that quickly," he said.</text>

<title>Justin Bieber jail video to be released with his genitals blurred</title>
<text>
(CNN) -- A Florida court technician has the job of blurring Justin Bieber's private parts on jail video before you can see it.

The video will then be handed over to news organizations this week under Florida's open records law, a Miami judge ordered Tuesday.

It's part of several hours of video captured by surveillance cameras inside the Miami Beach Police Department's jail, where Bieber was held after his arrest on DUI charges on January 23.

Miami-Dade County Judge William Altfield rejected arguments from Bieber's lawyer that the video should be kept private.

"The court finds that images of the defendant while in custody at the Miami Beach Police Department are relevant to the public's right to know," Altfield ruled Tuesday.

The segments to be released include a sequence in which Bieber "appears to be urinating" in a cell, "revealing an image of the defendant's genitalia," the judge wrote.

The order, however, instructs the court's video technician to blur "the image wherein genitalia is observed."

"While the defendant may not enjoy all of the expectations of privacy that he enjoys outside of a jail setting, he still retains his expectation of dignity," the judge said.

Several photographs taken by police of Bieber showing his tattoos were given to the media Tuesday.

Video showing Bieber doing push-ups in a jail cell and attempting a sobriety test in a hallway were released last month.

Florida's open records law gives the news media full access to documents, photographs and video collected by police unless there is a compelling reason to keep them private.

A status hearing is set for March 11 in Bieber's DUI case, which also includes a charge of resisting arrest without violence and driving with an expired license.</text>

<title>Rosberg wins Monaco GP</title>
<text>
(CNN) -- Nico Rosberg overcame accusations of gamesmanship to beat his Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton and win a tense and at times dramatic Monaco Grand Prix.

The German driver led from the start with early championship pace setter Hamilton, nursing an eye injury later in the race, having to make do with second place.

But the race, much like the build up, was dominated by tensions between the two Mercedes drivers. With Rosberg and Hamilton -- who were separated by just three championship points going in to the race -- vying for pole position on the final lap of qualifying Saturday, Rosberg left the track after his front wheel locked.

The stewards brought out caution flags, preventing Hamilton from completing his final qualifying lap and handing pole to Rosberg.

Rosberg claimed it was a simple error and a steward's inquiry agreed, concluding that there was "no evidence of any offense."

But Hamilton was less convinced.

"I found the time at the end and wasn't able to execute it so it wasn't a true showing of my true pace," the British driver told the BBC after qualifying.

"But I should have known that was going to happen and done it the lap before," he added.

Despite Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda voicing fears that the two drivers may collide at the first corner, the front row got away without incident and Rosberg built a strong lead on a course renowned for its difficulty in overtaking.

A stalemate followed until lap 28 when Sauber's Adrian Sutil crashed out, causing the safety car to come and provoking a flurry of tactical pit stops.

Thereafter Hamilton caught up with Rosberg, and looked set to challenge for the lead, until he suddenly dropped back, complaining to his team that he couldn't see out of his left eye.

In the end Hamilton was lucky to clinch second after Ricciardo pulled close in the final laps. But Hamilton held on.

The result saw Rosberg take the lead in the drivers championship, with Hamilton dropping back to second. But with many making comparisons between the famously bitter team rivalry between Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost, the battle, and the mind games, are likely to continue until the last race of the season.</text>

<title>Diet soda helps weight loss, industry-funded study finds</title>
<text>
(CNN) -- Most people choose artificially-sweetened soda over regular soda to avoid packing on extra pounds. But what if you already choose diet? Would it be helpful to quit that too?

Dr. Jim Hill says he gets this question all the time from patients in his weight loss program at the University of Colorado's Anschutz Health and Wellness Center.

With funding from the American Beverage Association, Hill helped design a study that divided approximately 300 adults into two groups: One group would continue drinking diet, and the other group -- referred to in the study as the "water group" -- would go cold turkey. The study was published in the journal Obesity.

Both participant groups received intensive coaching on successful techniques for weight loss, including regular feedback on the meals they logged in journals.

"The results, to us, were not at all surprising," says Hill.

While the typical participant banned from drinking diet sodas lost 9 pounds over 12 weeks, those allowed to continue drinking diet soda lost, on average, 13 pounds in the same time period. That's a 4-pound difference.

Hill says that in his clinical experience, many people who have successfully lost significant weight "are heavy users of noncaloric sweeteners."

But why was the diet soda group more successful? The most likely reason is that this group had the easier task.

Cutting calories and boosting exercise takes a lot of willpower. Trying to simultaneously give up something else you regularly enjoy -- such as diet soda -- taxes your ability to stay the course. Most psychologists agree that our willpower is a limited resource.

So while this study did not track calorie consumption, the group blocked from drinking diet sodas most likely ate (or drank) more calories over the course of the 12-week diet.

Since the study lasted just 12 weeks, it remains to be seen whether artificial sweeteners are beneficial in the long-term, says Susan Swithers, a professor of Behavioral Neuroscience at Purdue University. Swithers authored a report last year that found that diet soda drinkers have the same health issues as those who drink regular soda. It found that people who drink diet soda may be "at increased risk of excessive weight gain, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease," according to the study.

MORE: Study: Diet soda may do more harm than good

"What the prospective studies actually suggest is that if you go out 7 years, 10 years, 15 years, 20 years, the cohorts of individuals who are consuming diet sodas have much worse health outcomes," says Swithers.

Those studies show a correlation, and are not designed to show causation. But some researchers like Swithers suspect artificial sweeteners ultimately increase the desire for sweets.

"Doing these short-term studies that look at weight can't really tell us anything about whether or not these products are contributing to these increased risks," says Swithers. "And it's really hard to look at the (long-term) data and come up with any argument that they're helping."

Hill, who along with four other researchers, designed the study, which was selected for funding by the American Beverage Association from among multiple competing proposals. The American Beverage Association's membership includes numerous Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola bottling companies.

"It makes sense that it would have been harder for the water group to adhere to the overall diet than the (artificially-sweetened beverage) group," says Hill.

He added, "The most likely explanation was that having access to drinks with sweet taste helps the (artificially-sweetened beverage) group to adhere better to the behavioral change program."

Real or fake sugar: Does it matter?

In short, this study addresses the question of whether a regular diet soda drinker should attempt to kick his or her habit while also attempting to lose weight, not whether we should all drink more diet soda in order to lose weight.

Artificially-sweetened beverages "are not weight-loss enhancers, so it's not anything in the compounds themselves that are promoting weight loss," says Hill.

Kristi Norton, a regular diet soda drinker before the study began, was assigned to the group that required her to kick the habit. At the time of her CNN interview, she was not aware of the study's findings.

She says she lost 12 pounds during the course of the study, but the real difference is in how she feels.

"I feel like I could 1000% tell the benefit of drinking water only. I felt better, I had more energy, I felt healthier, I just generally felt way better," says Norton. "And I can feel the difference now when I drink a diet drink, I can feel this 'heaviness'."</text>

<title>AMC drama to become first show to ever premiere on Tumblr</title>
<text>
(EW.com ) -- Tumblr just became a lot more than the place to find the best GIFs.

In anticipation of its newest 10-episode series, "Halt and Catch Fire," AMC is launching a two-week, full-episode sneak preview on Tumblr and AMC.com, making it the first-ever television show to premiere on Tumblr.

"Halt and Catch Fire," created by Christopher Cantwell and Christopher C. Rogers, follows the rise of the PC in the early 1980s, roughly one year after IBM.

"Halt and Catch Fire is a fun ride through the early days of the PC era, a time when no one could imagine a portable computer weighing less than 15 pounds, let alone one that was a few ounces and doubled as a phone," AMC President Charlie Collier said in a statement. "It's a perfect show for summer and -- given the subject matter -- a good fit for Tumblr's first TV series premiere and AMC's first social media screening."

In addition to the launch of the new series, AMC also plans to launch a branded network Tumblr page to be integrated into AMC.com.

"Tumblr is the biggest platform for social TV and destination for many of AMC's most passionate fans," Global Head of Brand Partnerships at Tumblr Lee Brown said. "We're excited to welcome Halt and Catch Fire and the rest of AMC's lineup to the home of fandoms through Tumblr integration on AMC.com and to offer this first look at Halt and Catch Fire to our community."

Starting on Monday, May 19 and running through Saturday, May 31, viewers will be able to preview the new series on Tumblr and AMC.com before it premieres on AMC on Sunday, June 1 at 10 p.m.</text>
