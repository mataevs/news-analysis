<title>Painless ways to save on your daily coffee habit</title>
<text>
Is the cost of your daily caffeine jolt giving your budget the jitters?

Going to your favourite coffee shop four times per week for a simple brewed coffee will set you back 312 euro ($426) over the course of a year.

If you live in the US and prefer your espresso loaded with extras, buying a specialty coffee drink daily can cost close to $1,300 a year.

But reporter (and coffee fan) Kelsey Hubbard has uncovered the best ways to enjoy a caffeine rush, for less. Click on the arrow above to learn how  in 90 seconds.

<title>Do animals like drugs and alcohol?</title>
<text>
Is it true that elephants, monkeys, dolphins and other animals seek out recreational drugs in nature? Jason G Goldman investigates.

In South Africa, local legend has it that the elephants like to get drunk. They seek out the marula tree, overindulge on its sweet fruits, and enjoy the intoxicating effects of the slightly fermented juice.

Tales of the pie-eyed pachyderms go back at least two centuries. In the 1830s, a French naturalist called Adulphe Delegorgue described stories from his Zulu guides of mysteriously aggressive behaviour in male elephants after they fed on the marula fruits. "The elephant has in common with man a predilection for a gentle warming of the brain induced by fruit which has been fermented by the action of the sun," wrote Delegorgue.

Elephants aren't the only critters accused of indulging in the occasional cocktail or dose of drugs. Tales are told of wallabies getting high on poppy plants in Australia or dogs reportedly becoming addicted to the toxic substance secreted by cane toads. And stories abound of vervet monkeys on the Carribean island of St. Kitts, sneakily imbibing the brightly coloured cocktails of distracted tourists.

But how much of this is the result of projecting our own fascination with mind-altering substances onto other animals? Decades of laboratory research has shown that we can easily induce addictive behaviour in animals by making addictive substances easily available to them. But do wild animals really get drunk or high?

Vervet monkeys are one species that researchers hoped could help answer this question. Sometimes called green monkeys, they are native to Africa, but a handful of isolated groups wound up scattered across islands in the Caribbean. In the 18th and 19th Centuries, slavers often took the monkeys as pets, and when their ships landed in the new world, the monkeys easily escaped or were intentionally released. There, free of most of their predators, the small primates adapted quite well to tropical island life. For 300 years, the animals lived in an environment dominated by sugar cane plantations. And when the sugar cane was burned, or occasionally fermented before harvest, it became a treat for the monkeys. As they became accustomed to the ethanol in the fermented cane juice, the monkeys may have developed both a taste and tolerance for alcohol. Local stories are told of catching wild monkeys by supplying them with a mixture of rum and molasses in hollowed out coconut shells. The drunk primates could then be captured without hassle.

Descendants of those introduced monkeys have since been studied so that we can understand more about their boozy behavior. One study found that nearly one in five monkeys preferred a cocktail of alcohol mixed with sugar water over a sip of sugar water alone.

Intriguingly, younger individuals were more likely to drink than older individuals, and most of the drinking was done by teenagers of both sexes. The researchers, led by Jorge Juarez of Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, suspect that older monkeys shun alcohol because of the stresses of monkey politics. "It is [possible] that adults drink less because they have to be more alert and perceptive of the social dynamics of the group." In other words, at some point the monkeys leave their days of heavy drinking and hangovers behind and start acting like adults.

The same can't necessarily be said for rough-toothed dolphins, though. The marine mammals look a bit like the more familiar bottlenose variety, but can be distinguished by white markings around the beak. In 1995, marine scientist Lisa Steiner provided perhaps the first description of a peculiar behaviour she witnessed near the Azores.

One evening, she motored by an aggregation of some 50-60 dolphins, each in its own group of four-to-seven individuals. The dolphins appeared to be feeding, but they were acting strange, not displaying the typical high-energy behaviour. A few were lazily feeding, but many were just slowly swimming about. That's when she noticed the puffer fish. "Four inflated puffer fish were seen with the dolphins and one of them, which was upside down, was being pushed around by one of the dolphins," writes Steiner. She suspected that the behaviour was some sort of play. "Towards the end of the encounter, several of the dolphins were observed lying motionless at the surface with their backs and the tops of their heads clearly visible."

It isn't necessarily clear just what the dolphins were doing with the puffer fish, but their uncharacteristically lackadaisical behaviour implies to some that they were experiencing some mild intoxication from puffer fish venom, tetrodotoxin. A BBC documentary called Dolphins: Spy in the Pod that aired last year made the same argument. It's a controversial idea, because tetrodotoxin is so dangerous that a small dose can kill.

Writing at Discover Magazine, marine biologist Christie Wilcox explains: "Milligram-for-milligram, tetrodotoxin is 120,000 times as deadly as cocaine, 40,000 times as deadly as meth, and more than 50 million times as deadly as THC. It is tens to hundreds of times more lethal than the venoms of the most notorious animals in the world including the widow spiders and the black mamba. Its more potent than VX nerve gas, formaldehyde, or even ricin. It is, quite literally, one of the most toxic compounds known to man." She argues that curious, big-brained mammals, dolphins might explore puffer fish, and may accidentally expose themselves to a bit of the toxin, but is extremely sceptical of the notion that dolphins are dosing themselves intentionally, with such precision to achieve a bit of numbness without accidentally overdosing. In addition, tetrodotoxin isn't actually psychoactive. It induces numbness, but doesn't alter the mind, making it a poor choice of drug.

As for the elephants, the science is pretty clear. The animals are so massive that it would take a tremendous amount of the marula fruit to become intoxicated. Physiologists Steve Morris, David Humphreys, and Dan Reynolds of the University of Bristol first heard the rumours of the drunk elephants while in South Africa for a scientific conference, so they set about determining whether the legends might reflect some truth.

A search of the scientific literature supported the notion that elephants could at least become drunk. A 1984 study showed that they were happy to drink up a 7% alcohol solution, and several drank enough to alter their behaviour. While they didn't "act drunk", in human terms, they decreased the time spent feeding, drinking, bathing, and exploring, and became more lethargic. Several displayed behaviours that indicated they were uncomfortable, or perhaps slightly ill.

But just because elephants can become intoxicated doesn't mean that they do it in the wild routinely enough to inspire all the marula tree legends. A 3,000kg (6,600lb) elephant would have to drink between 10 and 27 litres of a 7% alcohol solution in a relatively short amount of time to experience any overt behavioural changes. Even if marula fruit contained 3% ethanol (a generous estimate) an elephant eating only marula fruits at a normal pace would barely consume half the alcohol necessary in a single day to become drunk. If it wanted to get drunk, given the constraints of its anatomy and physiology, an elephant would have to eat marula fruit at 400% its normal feeding rate while also eschewing all additional water intake. "On our analysis," the researchers conclude, "this seems extremely unlikely."

Still, something must explain the unusual behaviour of elephants around marula trees. Morris, Humphreys, and Reynolds offer two possible explanations. First, their unusually aggressive behaviour may simply reflect the fruit's status as a highly prized food item. A second, more intriguing hypothesis, is that there's another intoxicant that they're consuming. In addition to the fruits, elephants also sometimes eat the trees bark. This often contains beetle pupae, which contain a substance that local Africans historically used to poison their arrow tips. If they were ingesting the beetle toxin, perhaps that could explain the unusual antics of the pachyderms.

It's a seductive idea, isn't it? That other animals are as interested in getting as drunk and high as we are? While there are a few legitimate accounts of wild animals intentionally seeking out mind-altering substances, most such tales are based on legend and hearsay, and others simply have insufficient evidence to understand. Morris, Humphreys, and Reynolds point out that the majority of drunken animal stories are "anecdotal, mired in folklore and myth". And in a few cases, its possible that people are mistakenly attributing certain movements or temperaments to how humans act when inebriated. Wild animal drunkenness may only exist in the (occasionally tipsy) eye of the beholder.

<title>Does flossing your teeth prevent tooth decay?</title>
<text>
Can flossing reduce the risk of tooth decay? When you take a close look at the evidence, its not quite as straightforward as you may think.

How often do you floss your teeth? Its a question almost always asked by dentists when you are in the chair. Were advised that we should floss our teeth as well as brushing twice a day. But are we really clear on the exact benefit this might bring?

The idea is that flossing lowers your risk of tooth decay and gum disease by preventing the build-up of plaque. Plaque is the sticky film of bacteria fuelled by the carbohydrates we eat. If left to breed, these bacteria eventually begin to break down the tooths surface, leading to painful cavities that need filling, or even to the removal of the tooth if the decay is too widespread. Plaque begins to reform the minute you remove it, and if not removed it can lead to gingivitis, where gums become inflamed and bleed easily. In a 26-year longitudinal study of men in Norway, teeth surrounded by inflamed gums were 46 times more likely to be lost by the end of the study than teeth surrounded by healthy gums.

We know a toothbrush cannot address the plaque problem completely, as its so hard to reach areas between the teeth. The idea of using flossing to reach the rest is credited to a dentist from New Orleans called Levi Spear Parmly, who recommended using silk for the purpose back in 1815. But its not only humans who do it. Long-tailed macaques at the Buddhist shrine of Prang Sam Yot in Thailand take strands of long human hair and wind them round their fingers to get to those hard to reach parts of their mouths.

Theres plenty of evidence to suggest that flossing reduces plaque levels, but what evidence is there that flossing can reduce the risk of both tooth decay and gingivitis? When you take a close look at the research, its not quite as straightforward as you may think.

A review of flossing in children found it could reduce decay, but in adults its not been as easy to demonstrate. A review published by the respected Cochrane Collaboration in 2012 gathered all the existing research on flossing and found just 12 trials, mostly conducted in the US, where adults were randomised either to brush their teeth as usual or to floss in addition.

They werent impressed with what they found. Combining the results of the studies and re-analysing them, they found a possible small reduction in plaque, but the studies evidence was graded as weak and very unreliable. We are unable to claim or refute a benefit for flossing plus toothbrushing, they said. A reduction in plaque would suggest a reduction in tooth decay in the long-term, but not a single long-term randomised controlled trial had been done (the longest was nine months). None had included an assessment of tooth decay because it would be too soon to see any difference.

The findings for gingivitis tell us more. Flossing does help reduce the risk, if only by 8%. This was at least some positive news for flossing fans, in contrast to an earlier review from 2008 which found it couldnt demonstrate any benefits for regular flossing.

But the quality of the evidence makes it hard to come to any strong conclusions. Cochrane Reviews not only summarise all the data available, but they rate the research according to how well it was designed and conducted. They judged that many studies didnt come up to scratch, ranking the quality as low.

As poor as the evidence might be deemed to be, its still all we have to go on at the moment. So you could argue that if it may be useful for us, whats the harm in getting everyone to floss anyway? Self-inflicted damage could be the reason, and some studies have investigated this. One found that three of the 39 people taking part had damaged their gums one month into the study, but by two months, two of these people no longer had problems. Another found two people had damaged their gums by using a type of automatic flosser, but not in quite the right way.

If you want to know the right way to floss, heres a guide. And in the absence of any forthcoming evidence that could strengthen the case either way, if you are going to floss at least make sure it doesnt do you more harm than good.

<title>The secret link between money and happiness</title>
<text>
At the very least, money, or lack of it, can bring some level of joy or despair.

Youve heard the saying, money cant buy happiness, but what if a certain amount of money actually does make you happier? And dont people feel unhappy when they learn a colleague is earning more money for doing the same amount of work?

Several LinkedIn Influencers weighed in this week on why salaries shouldnt be secret and just how much money brings happiness. Heres what two of them had to say.

Very few people like to talk about how much money they make  especially not people who earn a lot of money, wrote Salmon in his post Why Salaries Shouldnt Be Secret, in the wake of news that recently-departed New York Times editor Jill Abramson had started asking questions about the pay discrepancy between her and her predecessor. Since companies tend to be run by people who earn a lot of money, the result is a culture of silence and secrecy when it comes to pay.

There are several surprising reasons secrecy surrounding pay is generally a bad idea for any organisation, Salmon wrote.

For one thing, secrecy about pay is bad for women, who are worse at asking for raises than men are. If men secretly ask for raises and secretly get them, while women dont, then that helps to explain, at least in part, why men end up earning more than women, Salmon wrote. Secrecy around pay is also a great way to allow managers to  consciously or unconsciously  play favorites with their staff.

Weve all worked in companies, Im sure, where the only way to get a substantial raise is to confront management with a job offer from somewhere else, he added. Thats clearly a dreadful way to run a company, since it gives all employees a huge incentive to spend a lot of time looking for work elsewhere, even if theyre very happy where they are.

If you work for a company where everybody knows what everybody else is earning, then its going to be very easy to see whats going on. Youll see who the stars are, youll see what kind of skills and talent the company rewards, he wrote. Youll also see whether men get paid more than women, whether managers are generally overpaid, and whether behaviour like threatening to quit is rewarded with big raises. Whats more, because management knows that everybody else will see such things, theyll be much less likely to do the kind of secret deals which are all too common in most companies today.

Maybe money does buy happiness. Or some money, that is. At least thats the case according to recent research from Princeton, yielded from a survey of 450,000 people.

The research found that emotional well-being is fully realised at an annual income of about $75,000. But not more.

In other words, when it comes to money, there is a glass ceiling for its ability to bring you happiness, wrote Kasanoff in his post $75,000 Buys Happiness; More Money Does Not. This makes intuitive sense; if you can't afford a decent place to live or enough food to feed your family, more money substantively improves your situation. But few would agree with the statement that the happiest moments of their life was/were when they had the most money.

The researchers examined emotional well-being, rather thanlife evaluation, wrote Kasanoff. Emotional well-being is what they equate with happiness. It involves the emotional experiences you have on a day-to-day basis... being delighted, sad, frustrated, excited, lonely or fascinated, he wrote.

What does all of this mean, then, in terms of money and happiness?

If you double your salary, say to $150,000, you will probably increase your intellectual assessment of your life, Kasanoff wrote. But doubling your salary won't necessarily give you more joy, day-to-day. It won't make you more excited by your work or help you feel closer to your friends and family.

<title>BBC Internet Blog: News Connected Studio</title>
<text>
Hi I am the head of product for BBC News Online and lead the product strategy and development of website, mobile, tablet and IPTV products for News.



The change of year is a good time to look back and also forward. In the BBC News Online product team in recent weeks we have been reflecting on a year in which we delivered a number of innovative product features to the audience while also planning an exciting event to kick off 2013: our first Connected Studio for News which begins on January 21.

With the delivery of our brand new responsive design website, our coverage of events such as the Diamond Jubilee and the US Presidential elections, 2012 was a huge success in News for what we call our 'Four Screen strategy'.

In the UK alone we saw a 28% increase in weekly unique browsers to our websites and applications, the number of tablets accessing our product more than trebled following a massive increase during Christmas week and there has been a 50% increase via smartphones.

Considering that one-third of our users are now not using a desktop PC it is essential that we continue to deliver great experiences across all devices from phones to connected TVs - not only in 2013 but beyond.

This is where Connected Studio comes in.

One thing that is clear to us from talking to the audience and seeing the trends in how people consume news is that in an age of an endless flow of information with access to the news from all the different devices we carry around with us, people increasingly want to more easily find news that is more relevant to them. It's not that people don't want to see the big major stories that affect us all and the BBC is committed to ensuring it uses its editorial skills to ensure the world is well informed about the things that really matter to the broadest audience. However, people are increasingly interested in lots of different topics which affect their own personal daily lives and we think we can do a better job in the future allowing you to follow stories that interest you across multiple devices. So this is the focus of our Connected Studio initiative - discovering ways to consume and distribute news that is more relevant to people. That might be news about where you live or where you work or what happens on the commute between the two places. Or it might be news about the industry you work in, or something that directly affects friends and family. Or just news about your hobbies and what interests you. We have a great opportunity to build on the systems and products BBC Online built for the Olympics in 2012 and use linked data to describe our content and make it easier to find. Our journalists are starting to tag stories accurately for the location, people, companies and organisations that they are about and then by linking this data together we will be able to make it possible for you to find and follow the news that affects you. Where our current local news sites only offer a limited view of the world in those areas, in future we will be able to surface stories about companies who employ lots of people in an area. Or when an MP has said something in the House of Commons which features on Democracy Live we will be able to show it immediately to people in the area that he or she represents and also to all the people interested in that subject. We also want to work with the wider media industry to link to other people's content more effectively in the same way. The Connected Studio is an opportunity for people from outside the BBC to meet up with experts from our teams, to play with our data and develop product ideas and prototypes which we will show to real audiences during the day. We are hoping to hear from many people across the media and digital industry who would like to get involved and help us with this exciting challenge. I look forward to seeing many interesting people gathering to help us on January 21 in the heart of the BBC's new journalism headquarters at New Broadcasting House in London. A creative brief for the studio has been published and you can sign up here. Chris Russell is head of product for BBC News Online.</text>

<title>Bill Murrays advice on travel and love</title>
<text>
According to the video posted on Deadspin.com: If you have someone that you think is The One, don't do dont just sort of think in your ordinary mind, 'Okay, let's make a date. Let's plan this and make a party and get married.' Take that person and travel around the world. Buy a plane ticket for the two of you to travel all around the world, and go to places that are hard to go to and hard to get out of. And if when you come back to JFK, when you land in JFK, and you're still in love with that person, get married at the airport.

We tend to agree with you Bill! In fact, the founder of BBC Travel did just that, proposing to his now wife after nearly a year on the road.

<title>Life lessons from Maya Angelou</title>
<text>
The American poet, author and activist has died at the age of 86. BBC Culture rounds up the words that gave her strength.

Maya Angelou is best known for her 1969 memoir I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, the first of seven volumes of autobiography telling the story of her life in the Deep South. She documented overcoming poverty, racial discrimination and giving birth as a teenager: here, she talks about what gave her strength.

My mother knew that it was dangerous for me to become silent. Thats still so, 69 years later... I sing, I speak, I speak loudly and firmly because mutism is like a drug, its so addictive  you dont have to do anything.

Love liberates, it doesnt just hold  thats ego. When [my mother] was on oxygen and fighting cancer for her life, I remembered her liberating me, and I said: I hope Ill be able to liberate her.

Everyone in the world has gone to bed one night or another with fear, or pain, or loss, or disappointment  and yet each of us has awakened arisen, somehow made our ablutions, seen other human beings and said: Morning, how are you? Fine, thanks  and you?.

No matter how heinous the crime, if a human being did it, I have to say I have in me all the components that are in her, or in him  I intend to use my energies constructively as opposed to destructively.

When I step up on a stage, when I stand up to translate, when I go to teach my classes, when I go to direct a movie, I bring everyone whos ever been kind to me with me  black, white, Asians, Spanish-speaking, native American, gay, straight  everybody. I say: Come with me, I need you now.

<title>Buying your first home sweet home</title>
<text>
When Lovelyn Joyce S Ocampo-Garcia and her husband were searching for their first house, they had a unique strategy: look for the biggest lot that would fit their budget with the smallest house they could live with.

Once you purchase land in a particular size, you are committed to that, said Ocampo-Garcia, 33, who lives in San Fernando in the Philippines province of Pampanga. The house you can renovate as your budget permits.

Today they live in a 54 square-metre house on a 366 square-metre lot, and theyre quite content. We love our home, Ocampo-Garcia said, and we understand the limits of our budget.

Not everyone is as money savvy about buying a home. In the UK, three-quarters of first-time homebuyers said they stretched themselves financially to afford it, according to a survey by the Money Advice Service, and 19% wish theyd spent less. More than half of recent US homebuyers said that in hindsight, they wished they had known more about financing, according to research from Chase Bank  and 39% would choose a different house if they could do it again.

One in three first-time homebuyers in Australia wished theyd done more house hunting before settling on a property, according to a survey by Mortgage Choice. And, three-quarters of Asian first homebuyers worry whether theyll even be able to afford a house, according to an iProperty Group survey in Malaysia, Indonesia, Hong Kong and Singapore.

Buying a home is a big commitment, both in terms of the price of a house and in the maintenance, upkeep and taxes youll be responsible for. Planning ahead can smooth the path to ownership.

Property is a big part of anyones net worth, said Peggy Creveling, a financial adviser with Creveling & Creveling Private Wealth Advisory in Bangkok, Thailand. So its a very important decision to get right. Often theres very little thought put into it.

Five Years to Go

Buying a house isnt always the most cost effective move. In Thailand, for instance, selling a property on the secondary market is very difficult, and the cost of buying and selling is significant, so unless youre going to be in the home for at least five to 10 years, buying isnt best, said Creveling.

Relative to rents, property prices tend to be high, she said. Consider all the costs involved in buying a home  mortgage payment, insurance, maintenance, taxes, moving costs, transaction fees  and compare them to rental costs.

Before you can make a clear plan, you have to know where youd like to live and what it might cost to live there. It pays to be thorough and research commute times, schools, community services and more. Take the time to explore communities yourself, rather than relying on internet research or word of mouth, and consider the type of housing and size of house you might need in a few years.

From there, youd probably look at contacting somebody in the industry or just looking online to get an idea of what prices for houses like that cost right now, said Julia Chung, a financial and estate planner with Facet Advisors in Langley, British Columbia in Canada.

Financial advisers suggest saving for a 20% down payment  and most people will be able to accomplish that if they plan five years ahead. In some countries, like China, if youre a first-time homebuyer, even more will be required. If you put down less, you may have to pay extra monthly fees for mortgage insurance in countries such as the US, Canada and Australia.

The main point is making your deposit as large as possible, said Brett Evans, executive director of Atlas Wealth Management in Southport, QLD, Australia.

The average house price in the UK sits at 254,000 ($428,473) and in the US, $334,200. Five years of savings might offer 60 months of time to accumulate a down payment, but aim for 54 months of savings so youll have your deposit ready ahead of time.

- Decide what you want

Four Years to Go

Owning a home is expensive beyond the down payment and cost of the loan. Theres regular maintenance, lawn care and unexpected appliance replacement.

Peter Falk and his wife lived on one income while they were saving up for a home in North Vancouver in British Columbia, Canada. My wifes income we put toward the down payment, said Falk, 36. They also saved periodic windfalls, such as bonuses. They expect to close on a three-bedroom duplex in June.

If you live in a country where credit is consistently tracked, such as Malaysia, the UK, the US, or Germany, its important to know where you stand.

You have to make sure your credit is in excellent shape so you can get the best possible mortgage, Chung said. In the US, youre entitled to a free annual report from the three credit reporting agencies at annualcreditreport.com. In the UK, you can get a report for 2 each ($3.37) from Equifax, Experian, and Callcredit. In Malaysia you may be able to get it from your bank.

Correct errors and take steps to improve your score, such as paying down debt and makingon-time payments to creditors. Check your credit annually to make sure youre seeing improvement.

- Live on less in order to save more

- Check your credit and correct any inaccuracies

Now is the time to make sure you are really on track. You want to be able to track how close you are to your goal, Chung said. Is this plan working?

Monitor property prices in your chosen area and make sure they havent changed significantly. Check your savings totals to see if you have as much as you need at this point  and if not, how you should adjust your future savings rate. Also, has your family situation changed? Are you having a child  or another child? Will you need to care for an ageing parent or other relative? Factor these into the expectation for the size of home you might need and its cost.

If you dont already live in the city you plan to buy in, you may want to rent there first. Thats what Anthony Bianco did before he purchased his home in Brisbane, Australia. For the first few years when he was saving, he lived in a remote area with low costs so he could put a large chunk of money away. Then he moved to Brisbane.

Brisbane was new to me, said Bianco, who runs travel site TravelTart.com. Renting was a good opportunity to gain a feel for the better suburbs in terms of facilities and access to public transport.

You may want to start scouting houses far in advance of your purchase date. It will give you an idea of how active the market is, how quickly houses sell and what youll get for your money. If the market is very competitive, it could take you a year or two to find the right home.

We looked for a year and a half and the process was very frustrating due to the cost per square foot of owning a home in Vancouver, Peter Falk said.

- Consider renting in your target area before buying

One Year to Go

In many countries, the process of closing on a home is lengthy  two to three months or more  but you can do a few things ahead of time. For instance, in some cases there is a pre-approval process that enables you to complete a loan application and get initially approved for a mortgage of a certain size. You will be asked to provide proof of income, recent bank and financial statements, tax returns, and information on household expenses and loans. If your deposit comprises a family gift, you may have to provide proof of the amount.

Speak to the bank about getting pre-approval and getting an idea of how much you can borrow based on your income and the size of your deposit, Evans said. This makes you a stronger buyer in a bidding war on a house, and may shorten the process once you have an accepted offer.

Its also advisable to get an estimate for taxes, fees, and insurance that will accompany your purchase, which can affect how much cash you need up front, and could increase your monthly payments.

Once youve found a home you like, its time to complete the process. That means making an offer (and having it accepted), having surveys, inspections and any necessary legal work done, securing insurance, and finalizing the paperwork for your loan.

These steps differ from place to place, but build in time and costs for inspections, ownership transfer and more.

My wife and I were disciplined and we have put ourselves in a great position to raise kids and enjoy a family, said Peter Falk, who is expecting his first child in September. We feel great about it.</text>

<title>Cappadocia's twin-peaked shadow : Hiking, Turkey</title>
<text>
The image is commonly thought to depict a village in the foreground, looked down upon by a twin-peaked volcano that is spewing an explosion of lava and rock into the sky. Dated to approximately 6200 BC, it is thought to be the world's first landscape drawing. Some experts describe it as the first ever map. And the distinctive twin-peaked volcano is usually identified as Mount Hasan.

Its impossible to miss Mount Hasan (Hasan Da in Turkish) as you drive through Cappadocia. The silhouette of its stark twin peaks dominates the skyline of the region's southwest, bearing down upon the surrounding steppe. Yet despite being only 18km south from the Ihlara Valley  one of Cappadocia's most popular tourist attractions  the jagged and barren slopes of Mount Hasan are rarely explored.

The Ihlara Valley is famous for its blend of unusual rock formations, and its deep gorge floor is scattered with fresco-filled cave-cut church remnants from the monastic Byzantine communities who once made the valley their home. But as the atalhyk wall painting shows, Mount Hasan has been making an impact on Anatolia settlers for millennia. Hiking up the mountain is not just about bagging another summit. It is a journey to the rumbling heart of Neolithic man's fear.

My friends and I camped on a pasture at the mountain's base, pitching our tents between the simple stone shelters used by local shepherds during the summer months. I stared at the mountain slope that billowed upwards in jagged contortions and then turned the other way to face the Anatolian plains, which rolled out in an uninterrupted hazy sheet of green and taupe. The archaeological site of atalhyk may lie 130km to the southwest, but at 3,253m high and with only rippling plateau in between, the stratovolcano (its conical shape built up by strata of pumice, ash and lava) remains a domineering and shadowy force on the Neolithic town's horizon. Its last eruption is thought to date back 9,000 years: about the same time period that the unknown artist drew the scene on their wall.

Our ascent began in the morning. Rusty-hued boulders were splattered with brushstrokes of lime-green lichen. Snow finches darted between the rocks, disturbed by our crunching footfalls on their territory. In the Neolithic era the mountain was not only a natural force to be feared, but also played an important role in atalhyk's development. People came to the volcano's lower slopes to collect shiny and sharp black obsidian, which they prized as tools and traded with other towns.

The gradient got gradually steeper as we pushed upwards. I stopped for a break and looked back at the plains below, which, at this height, had turned into a fuzzy carpet of indistinct shapes. Hills appeared as inconsequential pimples. In the far distance west, we could see the sparkly glimmer of the vast Tuz Gl salt lake, which lies between the cities of Aksaray and Ankara.

Eventually the pink- and orange-hued stones of the lower slopes gave way to mammoth jagged black boulder slabs that were stacked like a giant game of Jenga. Alpine swifts swooped across the sky, circling and diving in aerobatic formations. I clambered up a stone-river of scree that snaked down the slope, and paused to get my breath. The high altitude air had a tinge of alpine crispness to it; so fresh you could almost taste it. Except for the crunch of footfalls, slipping and sliding as we battled the loose stones, it was silent. Someone yelped as a misjudged step sent a rock avalanche of tiny missiles showering down. The cry echoed out across the mountain.</text>

<title>How to ford water, the Land Rover way</title>
<text>
On a Land Rover-designed terrain course, a water feature is no mere puddle.

The Range Rover Sport was plodding through two feet of murk, a little wave rolling beyond its nose toward terra firma. Steer a little to the right. Its deeper over there, commanded Tim Hensley, an instructor with the Land Rover Experience Driving School. Wittingly or unwittingly, Hensley had illustrated the first principle of water-fording: know whats under the tires  or at least travel with someone who does.

With locations around the world (often attached to luxury hotels), the Land Rover Experience Driving School teaches motorists how to get the most out of their go-anywhere machines. At the recent Kentucky Three-Day equestrian event, which Land Rover sponsored, an ad-hoc obstacle course was where passersby could sample the brands North America model line (read: no Defender). After the proper waivers were signed and valid licenses presented, Hensley and his instructors schooled drivers on the finer points of off-road etiquette and common sense.

<title>The surprising downside to being debt free</title>
<text>
But what happens if we always struggle to pay the bill at end of the month? We turned to question-and-answer-site Quora for some advice on whether it is really a worthy goal to be debt free . Heres what some respondents had to say about borrowing.

Weve all done it. Weve all bitten off more debt than we can swallow: borrowing to go to school, borrowing to buy a house, borrowing to pay for that nice holiday to the Caribbean. As we move to a cashless society , its even easier these days to just pull out our credit card to pay for croissant and coffee rather than digging around for change. In many ways, debt is all about convenience.

That burning question is missing an important qualifier: the type of debt incurred, said Konstantinos Boulis. Consumer debt must be avoided like the plague. When you buy anything worth $100 and you pay it back in one year you will pay on average about $120. This is just dumb. You not only bought something that you probably didn't need but also paid 20% more.

 

 Investment debt, he continued, is a whole different game and you should be makingcontrolled decisions on what to invest in and what not to. Getting a mortgage in today's market with a 30-year APR [annual percentage rate] of 3.5% is probably a very good movegiven the right circumstances.

If you still think that debt is evil then that's ok, you will be able to sleep better at night, he added. It's just that the bed may not be that comfortable and your house smaller than what you wanted.

In some cases, debt should be embraced as a way to create an awesome life, according to Jeremy Karmel. For many people debt is an extremely useful tool for achieving that goal.

Karmel cites the cost of education as one place where debt is justifiable. If you want to be a doctor or a lawyer and you don't come from an extremely wealthy family, good luck trying to do those things without borrowing money for school.

Taking on a lot of debt is a HUGE commitment he continued. You should really have a realistic plan for paying it back. That said, for many people borrowing is extremely freeing, it lets them pursue their dreams years earlier than they otherwise would have been able to.

You should buy things you need at the time you need them most, said Vivek Nagarajan. I borrowed money to buy a motorbike, he said. I borrowed money to go live in a faraway country to marry the person I loved. I borrowed for various things that gave me great joy, like taking a month off and riding a motorbike in Ladakh for 18 days. The list goes on.

All in all I have been in constant credit card debt since the past 10 years, he continued.

But, my income has always been enough to cover my payments, and while I may have paid a premium of 20% or so overall due to interest and fees, my income has grown by a factor of 10 or 1000% since 2003, so the math works in favour of buying now and not worrying later. Had I postponed my purchases until I had saved up it would have been much too late and a huge waste of time.

Marc Bodnick made the point that the appropriateness of debt can depend on your age. While you are young and just getting started in your career, debt is more acceptable. But over time, once you have greater earning power, you should avoid it. Debt is constraining. It keeps you from being able to make long-term good choices about your life. You want to be able to take lots of risks and fail (more than once) and debt keeps you from rolling the dice.

It all depends on whether your return on the money is greater than your cost, Gil Eyal said. Simply put, if you could borrow at a 2% rate and be guaranteed to make 5%, you should strive to be in as much debt as possible, he said. This actually isn't that far-fetched. If you are a great real estate investor for example, you would always try to finance part of your deals with low cost debt, knowing you are making money on other peoples dime and spreading your own over more deals.

Jett Fein offers a different perspective. It depends on how you think about debt, he said. Different cultures have radically different views on debt. The Tiv of West Africa have one of the most interesting perspectives on debt that I've encountered: they view indebtedness as a good thing because it implies you will have continuing and long lasting interpersonal relationships.

Some respondents take the higher moral ground, saying you should avoid debt at all costs. Debt is slavery, said Brian Fey. It is better to die a free man than to live as a slave.

Phil Bradford sums it up with a verse from the Bible: The rich rule over the poor, and the borrower is servant to the lender.

And Amadasun Efe compares debt to climbing a mountain with a backpack full of rocks. The bigger the debt gets, the bigger the rocks get, he wrote. Soon enough the force pulling you down will be more than you can overcome, and then it's all downhill from there.

Everybody else is moving up faster than you are because they don't have anything holding them back. In a sense, they are free. You on the other hand have become a physical and mental slave to the boulder of debt that is crushing you. All you can think of is how to get rid of the weight on your back, because it has become an unhealthy obsession.

Now freedom, Efe said, is another thing altogether. Suddenly [you are] in a state of mind where everything seems possible. Obstacles are merely a construct, not a reality; and you can think uninhibitedly. Clearly you are in a better place. A worthy place. A place where you are truly in control.

<title>Goodbye corporate ladder</title>
<text>
The world of big business would have been the first port of call for ambitious new graduates, wrote Maite Baron, chief executive officer at The Corporate Escape, a London-based career-transition consultancy that helps disillusioned employees become business owners.

With todays roller coaster economy, many new graduates are eschewing the corporate ladder in favour of temporary positions or the chance to be their own boss.

Now, however, not only has the corporate sector far fewer jobs to offer, but they also look increasingly unattractive  tarnished as they are by bad practice, and with salaries, pensions and perks that seem inadequate compensation for the high stress and long hours required, Baron said.

In Europe, the numbers for self-employment are quite high: In the UK, roughly 15%of workers are self-employed while in Greece, that number jumps to 30%, according to the European Working Conditions Observatory (EWCO). In the US, the number is 6.6%, according to a recent report from CareerBuilder.

Striking out on your own

There are very few times in ones life or career when unconventional moves are actually feasible. Right after college or grad school is one, wrote Bernd Schoner, author of The Tech Entrepreneurs Survival Guide: How to Bootstrap Your Startup, Lead Through Tough Times, and Cash In for Success.

There are a number of reasons why new graduates make great entrepreneurs, according to Schoner. One of the big ones is the blessing of poverty, he wrote. Students and graduates are used to a student lifestyle. [They] typically dont have a large family to feed, they dont fly business class, and they dont pay interest on mortgages.

Therefore, they can live on little or no salary and have financial flexibility as a new business ramps up.

Another reason is what Schoner calls the innocent enthusiasm of new graduates. Many a young graduate entrepreneur founds a company without too much concern about how much work it will be, how long it will take to make it successful or how risky it may be, he wrote. Sometimes it helps to just stumble into a big undertaking like founding a tech company before you can grasp the full implications of it.

Just because you dont have all of the skills necessary for the new business doesnt mean you shouldnt go for it, wrote The Corporate Escapes Baron. You can make up for any shortfall in your skills and experience by around you building a dream team of supporters, experts, mentors, and advisers who do have the knowledge thats needed. Attract them to you through your enthusiasm, passion and vision.

Baron suggested using freelance experts as one way to add to the skills base of your business without breaking your budget.

Why stop with one?

Increasingly common are portfolio working graduates who gain their income from several different sources, according to Bruce Woodcock, a careers adviser at University of Kent in Canterbury, England.

If one job disappears, you still have another source of income, he wrote. Graduates often embrace the freedom offered to them by short-term contracts, changing employers and abandoning the linear career in favour of portfolio working or combining employment with setting up their own business.

Ross Johnson, branch manager of staffing firm Addison Groups Healthcare Practice in Dallas, Texas, wrote that he has seen an increase in millennials leveraging temporary positions as opportunities to explore different fields, companies and roles.

A majority dont know exactly what they want to do for a career, wrote Johnson. Taking a temporary position is a great way to gain experience and get a feel for the industry or specific company before making a firm commitment.

Just dont job hop too quickly, advised Johnson. Try to give the position at least a year.

A year provides a candidate a good sense of what they liked and didnt like about a position or company, and helps them better understand what to look for in their next role, he wrote. It can also help recent graduates get in the mindset of a real-world routine and corporate environment.

<title>Where Google trains its drivers not to drive</title>
<text>
As Google unveils plans to build driverless cars itself, Jack Stewart gets an inside look at the companys robot driving school.

During a recent visit to Google HQ in Californias Mountain View campus, I got a glimpse of what the future of undriving might look like.

I was given access to the team behind the search giants self-driving car programme. Part of Google X, the companys the semi-secret research arm, the crew is usually hidden away from the public eye. I was there to find out what it takes to use this technology, and what its like to be a Google test driver; taking a backseat to the cars computers even when sat behind the steering wheel.

It was an interesting time to observe just how ready driverless cars are for the road. Today, Google announced plans to start building its own vehicles, rather than relying on other manufacturers. So far, Google has fitted its driverless technology into existing cars, such as the Toyota Prius and Lexus RX450hs.

Yet Googles own vehicles will be cute little city cars with smiling, non-threatening faces, and pedestrian friendly crash features. The companys reasoning is that if its cars are going to be autonomous, they neednt follow conventional designs.

Although Googles new cars are designed to eventually dispense with steering wheels and pedals, at first Google wants to fit the cars with human-specific controls, which can be plugged in and layered on top of the autonomous controls, so that the cars can be safely tested on public roads. They will be very much like the vehicle I travelled in, which has a steering wheel and pedals in case the human driver needs to take over.

They may not touch the controls for the majority of a drive, but they still have to be here, still have to stay constantly alert, scanning the road, watching for mistakes made by their autonomous chauffeurs.

Ultimately, its a success if the journeys are as uneventful as possible. During the ride, its OK if its boring, because that means its safe, says Brian Torcellini, Googles lead test driver and the man responsible for training other drivers not to drive. He has been with the team since 2009, and was one of the first autonomous car pilots.

Googles current fleet  around a couple of dozen cars  lives at Googles home base in Mountain View. The Google test drivers are not allowed to take them home. The early blue Toyota Prius vehicles have been replaced with bright white Lexus SUVs. They are easy to spot; they have a rather ungainly laser scanner on the roof, and the companys logo in primary colours on the side.

The drivers check in, just like everyone else would in the morning, explains Torcellini. They take the cars out, run some tests, and then they come back and drop the cars off and upload the data.

Googles drivers have to learn to let the machine do the driving  but they are also encouraged to be very cautious about the cars abilities. If they ever feel in the slightest bit uncomfortable with the way the computer is driving, they are told to wrest control away immediately with a tap of a pedal or turn of the steering wheel. Engineers can then collect information from the computers, and extrapolate and simulate what the car would have done. The comparison between the hypothetical action and the human intervention can be used to help improve the cars software.

Even though theyre supposed to be cautious, the drivers are also trained for the extremes. They take cars through their paces on slaloms and skidpans on a test track, to really experience how they perform at the limit. They are conditions that theyre very unlikely to encounter on the road, but the hope is that if they encounter ice, for instance, the computers will know how to react.

Most of the driving we do isnt drifting around cones, says Torcellini, but we feel like the best thing to do is to overtrain our folks.

So what is it like to sit in a car being driven by a computer? There is certainly no sliding sideways around corners on the day I sat in the back of a Google SUV, one of the companys first-generation vehicles complete with steering wheel .

It turns out that one of the cars biggest challenges begins before it hits the road; the drivers have to take to the controls to negotiate our way out of the car park before we hear the soothing female tone of the autodriving announcement that tells us the computer is taking over.

A lot of parking lots, in some ways, are even more complicated than public roads, explains Alyssa, the safety driver. There are often no proper lane markings, and they are full of people walking in all directions and obstacles like shopping trolleys. Its the kind of busy, hazard-heavy driving environment humans are instinctively able to process, but that might be less obvious to a computer.

The crew also helps refine the cars software, by keeping a log of the driving experience, updated on a laptop from the passengers seat. Were constantly leaving comments about little things that we think could feel smoother or more human-like, says Alyssa. Test drives are essential to get to the heart of how the journey feels, for the passengers and the people around. The objective is to make the cars driving seem natural, to integrate well with other cars, and not feel jerky or hesitant.

The car accelerates at a fair pace, and copes with other traffic, cyclists, and pedestrians, when they appear, cameraphones poised, to get a snap of us whizzing by. Even in Silicon Valley, driverless cars get attention in a way that would make a Ferrari owner jealous  something the two drivers are by now are used to. A lot of people do have the view that we have a really cool job  and we do! says Loren. This is history in the making, and its fantastic to be a part of it.

Torcellinis advice if you fancy a job driving a car with no steering wheel? We are looking for people with good judgment, he says. That can be hard to establish in just one sit-down interview so the recruitment process is multi-stage, and includes a driving interview. The process is tough, but if the companys fleet expands as ambitiously as Googles new announcement suggests, one thing is clear. Theres going to be a need for a lot more human test drivers before we have a world full of computer-controlled cars.

<title>The Indianapolis 500, fuelled by tradition</title>
<text>
When I dream about the moonlight on the Wabash, then I long for my Indiana home.

Jim Nabors' mellow baritone wafts out over the Indianapolis 500 crowd, a quarter-million people roasting in the sun like so many hot dogs on the grille. It is the last time this will happen, and a palpable current of emotion courses through the stands at Indianapolis Motor Speedway  more than one might expect given the singer is a rangy Alabama native best known for his portrayal of a bumbling mechanic.

Since 1972, the man who played Gomer Pyle on US televisions The Andy Griffith Show has sung this tune 37 times. He is an honourary Hoosier, as much a part of this race as the brickwork that runs from the finish line right out to the infield.

The stands reflect a mix of generations, and there's a teary eye or two as the final strains echo out, Indiana, Indiana home. A rising tidal wave of cheering, the swell of nearly 300,000 people roaring in farewell. Nabors, 83, steps back from the tracks microphone for the last time. Mari Hulman-George, whose family has owned the circuit since 1945, issues one of the most famous commands in racing. Gentlemen, start your engines.

The Indianapolis 500, the self-proclaimed Greatest Spectacle on Earth, is built on a bulwark of traditions such as this song. Established in 1911 in the very heart of Americas heartland, the 500-mile endurance race is as much about the attendant pageantry as it is about elite driving. Even the starting lap formation, where 11 rows of cars stacked three abreast pace the field, is a century old.

That first race  won by a single-seater Marmon Wasp that looks hulking here today next to the spacecraft silhouette of a modern IndyCar machine  was run on bricks. Roughly 3.2m of them were lain over the original track's crushed limestone and tar surface, earning the world's first speedway the nickname the Brickyard.

A yard-wide strip of those original bricks still peeks through, with the rest of the track rendered smooth by paving. Only the drivers know what it must feel like to cross that rumpled surface at speeds exceeding 230mph and know that there's just one lap to go, one more passing attempt to make to grasp victory.

Those who win have another tradition: kissing the bricks. Thousands of spectators can be seen re-enacting the genuflection first made by Nascar driver Dale Jarrett and his team after triumphing in the Brickyard 400. The modern interpretation makes room for lying on one's back to snap the obligatory selfie. Just before the race, those with pit passes have unparalleled access, and thousands mill between the waiting cars on the very track where battle will take place. A yellow-clad track marshal, seeing the hundreds planting kisses on the bricks, remarks somewhat cryptically, If they'd seen what I'd seen, they wouldn't be doing that.

There are older traditions, too. In a homage to a hot-air balloon race held here that actually pre-dates the first Indy by two years, a huge cloud of balloons are released just before the race. These multi-coloured constellations have been rising into the air since 1947.

The Purdue All-American Marching Band tramps around the perimeter of the track, young men and women sweating in their heavy uniforms as they have done since the race re-commenced after a hiatus during World War II. As the Indy takes place on the USs Memorial Day, Nabors Back Home Again in Indiana has been joined by Stars and Stripes Forever and another local favourite, On the Banks of the Wabash.

This year's pacecar, carrying on another hundred-year tradition, is a Chevrolet Camaro Z/28, driven by three-time Indy winner Dario Franchitti. The Scotsman with the dashing looks and Italian name leads the field out to loop slowly past the crowds, IndyCars sawing back and forth across the track to warm their tires, and then lining up in formation.

This day, Franchitti will lead the field out again with just eight laps to go, and when his jet-black Camaro leaves the track for the final time, the resultant sprint will see a flurry of passing and re-passing. Five-hundred miles later, the victory would go to Ryan Hunter-Reay by less than a car-length, the first win by a US driver in eight years.

On the podium, Hunter-Reay stood holding his 17-month-old son, both clad in identical yellow racing suits, and drank from a bottle of Indiana milk. Another tradition, this dates back to 1936, when driver Louis Meyer quaffed buttermilk after a victory. The dairy industry was quick to grasp the potwinnential for publicity, and nearly every winning driver since 1956 has taken a swig from a glass bottle. In a notable exception, Emerson Fittipaldi drank orange juice after his 1993 victory to promote his groves. The crowd roundly booed him.

To the victor go some long-standing spoils: since 1936, nearly every driver has been awarded the pacecar or a replica thereof; since 1976, each driver has received an Indy 500 themed quilt. And lastly, the winners face is immortalised on the five-foot-high Borg-Warner trophy, which has been stretched twice to make space.

Though the race itself is a showcase of technology, of tire compounds, of aerodynamics and precisely controlled turbocharging, the soul of Indy resides in far more than the engineering. In the breast of America's heartland, a legend stands, built on tradition, brick by brick.</text>

<title>In Japan, legal muscle for a little scooter</title>
<text>
On 26 May, Honda announced that the Japan Patent Office had granted a three-dimensional trademark registration for the shape of the companys venerable Super Cub motor scooter. The decision may at last help Honda at last stem the tide of knock-off scooters that borrow the Super Cub's distinctive profile.

The Super Cub has been in production since 1958, and in that time, Honda has delivered close to 90m of them in 160 countries. Throughout, despite consistent functional upgrades, the basic shape of the bike has remained constant. As a result, reads the Honda press release, it came to a point where most consumers who see the design of the Super Cub recognize it as a Honda product, and that became one of the determining factors for the Japan Patent Office to grant the trademark.

Defending the newly trademarked Super Cub shape may prove somewhat trickier. The notion of trademark protection for three-dimensional products and packaging is relatively new, and cases defending the sanctity of familiar shapes can be long, expensive and inconclusive. Among the better-known trademarked shapes are McDonalds Ronald McDonald clown, Coca-Colas curvaceous bottle and Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Spirit of Ecstasy figure.

Honda is the first carmaker in Japan to score trademark status for one of its products.

<title>Pushing the envelope: 10 movies that broke film taboos</title>
<text>
The Hollywood production code instituted in 1934 forbade the depiction of interracial relationships. But several films began to challenge the code in the 1950s. Stanley Kubricks Killers Kiss (1955) may feature the very first kiss between a white woman (Irene Kane) and a black man (Jamaican-born Frank Silvera). Silvera, who had very light skin, was not actually playing a black character in the film, and it is doubtful much of the audience at the time would have been aware he was of African descent. Island in the Sun, from 1957, came closer. It featured a romance between a mixed-race Caribbean girl (Dorothy Dandridge) and a British colonial official (John Justin), but rather than kiss, they merely nuzzle each others cheeks. It may be then that The Crimson Kimono (1959) is the first Hollywood movie to feature a true interracial kiss: between Japanese-American James Shigeta and Victoria Shaw. (AF archive/Alamy)</text>

<title>How Shakespeare influences the way we speak now</title>
<text>
Even if youve never seen a Shakespeare play, youll have used one of his words or phrases. Hephzibah Anderson explains his genius  and enduring influence.

If you missed Shakespeares 450th birthday, you can be sure hed have had a zinger of a putdown to sling your way. Or better yet, a whole string of them. Thou art a boil, a plague sore, an embossed carbuncle in my corrupted blood" might just do it, borrowedfrom King Lear railing against his daughter, Goneril.Or perhaps hed settle for more aloof damnation, along the lines of Orlandos insult to Jaques in As You Like It: I do desire we may be better strangers.

That isnt a wish likely to be granted to Shakespeare any time soon. Yes, his 450th birthday has been and gone already, but its worth noting that all over the world, people paused to acknowledge it in the first place. In fact, during his 52 years on earth, he enriched the English language in ways so profound its almost impossible to fully gauge his impact. Without him, our vocabulary would be just too different. He gave us uniquely vivid ways in which to express hope and despair, sorrow and rage, love and lust. Even if youve never read one of his sonnets or seen a play  even if youve never so much as watched a movie adaptation  youre likely to have quoted him unwittingly. Its almost impossible to avoid.

Of course, fellow artists readily draw on him for paintings, operas and ballets. Shakespeares influence is evident in popular as well as high culture: singer-songwriter Nick Lowes 1970s earworm, Cruel to be Kind, took its title from lines Hamlet addressed to his mother. I must be cruel only to be kind, the Prince of Denmark tells her in a wriggling kind of apology for killing a courtier and meddling in her new relationship. Hamlet also yielded the title of Agatha Christies theatrical smash, The Mousetrap, and Alfred Hitchcocks evocative spy thriller, North by Northwest. And then theres David Foster Wallaces iconic novel, Infinite Jest, Ruth Rendells Put on by Cunning, Philip K. Dicks Time Out of Joint and Jasper Ffordes Something Rotten. That one play alone has inspired other writers in numerous genres, at far-flung ends of the literary spectrum.

And what of Shakespeare's other plays? Well, when Mumford and Sons named their album Sigh No More, they were borrowing a phrase from Much Ado About Nothing. As for Iron Maidens song Where Eagles Dare, how many of their fans recognise it as a quote from Richard III?

These catchy titles barely gesture to Shakespeare's influence on the minutiae of our lives. If youve ever been in a pickle, waited with bated breath, or gone on a wild goose chase, youve been quoting from The Tempest, The Merchant of Venice and Romeo and Juliet respectively.

Next time you refer to jealousy as "the green-eyed monster," know that youre quoting Othellos arch villain, Iago. (Shakespeare was almost self-quoting here, having first touched on green as the colour of envy in The Merchant of Venice, where Portia alludes to green-eyed jealousy.)

Allow yourself to gossip (A Midsummer Nights Dream), and youre quoting him. "The be-all and end-all" is uttered by Macbeth as he murderously contemplates King Duncan, and "fair play" falls from Mirandas lips in The Tempest. And did I mention that he invented the knock-knock joke in the Scottish play?

Some phrases have become so well used that theyre now regarded as clichs  surely a compliment for an author so long gone. "A heart of gold"? Youll find it in Henry V, while the worlds mine oyster crops up in The Merry Wives of Windsor.

His impact endures not only in the way we express ourselves, but how we experience and process the world around us. Had Shakespeare not given us the words, would we truly feel bedazzled (The Taming of the Shrew)? Had he not taught us the word gloomy (Titus Andronicus), would it be a feeling we recognised in ourselves? And could we grovel effectively (Henry VI, Part II) or be properly sanctimonious (The Tempest) had he not shown us how?

Victorian word expert F Max Muller estimated that Shakespeare used 15,000 words in his plays, a portion of which he invented himself by merging existing words and anglicising vocabulary from foreign languages. By contrast, Milton used a mere 8,000 and the Old Testament is made up of 5,642. Meanwhile, an unschooled agricultural worker of the day would have said all that he had to say in fewer than 300 words.

Recently, two antiquarian booksellers in the US declared that theyd found a book they believe to be Shakespeares dictionary. The book, which was on eBay, was a copy of John Barets Alvearie, a popular late-16th-Century dictionary in four languages. Its densely annotated throughout but the clincher, they believe, is the handwritten word salad on the tomes blank back page, a sheet filled with a mix of French and English words, some of which ended up in Shakespeares plays.

Scholars have argued back and forth over just how many of these words and phrases Shakespeare actually coined, and how many he merely popularised by bedding them down in a memorable plot. In the past few years, quantitative analysis and digital databases have allowed computers to simultaneously search thousands of texts, leading scholars to believe that we may have overestimated his contribution to the English language.

According to a 2011 paper by Ward EY Elliott and Robert J Valenza of Americas Claremont McKenna College, new words attributed to Shakespeare have probably been over-counted by a factor of at least two. The OED is coming to reflect this: in the 1950s, Shakespeares tally of first-use citations stood at 3,200. Today, its around 2,000.

In some ways, this makes Shakespeares flair and originality all the more impressive. His linguistic arsenal didnt contain vastly more than those of his contemporaries, and yet his are the stories we remember. Not that 2,000 is bad going, especially when so many of those words saturate our everyday speech.

How did he manage it, you might wonder? Its partly his turn of phrase. Would fashionable have caught on had not set it in such a wry sentence as this in Troilus and Cressida? For time is like a fashionable host, that slightly shakes his parting guest by th' hand." Then theres the fact that these words are voiced by some unforgettable characters  men and women who, despite the extraordinary situations in which they tend to find themselves, are fully and profoundly human in both their strengths and frailties. Its little wonder that critic Harold Bloom titled his 1998 book on the man Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human.

If the mark of a great writer is that theyre still read, then perhaps the mark of a genius is that theyre still spoken, too.
