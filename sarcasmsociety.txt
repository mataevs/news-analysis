<title>Top 10 Reasons Why Android is Better than iOS</title>
<text>
In light of yesterday’s announcement by Apple about all the ‘improvements’ they are introducing in iOS 8, I thought that I would put an end to the debate of which is better, Apple or Android. To that end, here are the top 10 reasons Android is better than iOS.
It has a cooler name.
It was an acquisition by Google (so they must have been doing something good).
It has a mascot. And it’s a freakin’ robot!
It has cool names like ‘Kitkat’ and ‘Jelly Bean’, instead of boring numbers (i.e., iOS8).
It lets users easily make phone calls, and even browse the web.
It has a dizzying number of apps.
It helps phone manufacturers offer top-of-the-line phones (e.g., Samsung Galaxy S 5) at a bargain-basement price of around $600.
It creates a highly uniform experience across the entire Android ecosystem.
It leaves OS update availability up to the phone companies.
It lets phone companies include highly useful and uninstallable apps.</text>

<title>Walnuts are good for your nuts</title>
<text>
A new study claims that men can improve the quality of their sperm by eating a daily ration of walnuts.
The study, funded in part by the California Walnut Commission, shows men who consumed 75 grams of walnut a day for a period of twelve weeks had better sperm quality compared to when they started the regiment.
“It would be relatively easy to poke fun at studies like this, but there is increasing evidence to show that aspects of a man’s diet can affect the number and quality of sperm produced by his testicles,” Dr. Allan Pacey, senior lecturer in andrology at the University of Sheffield, said to the BBC.
Easy to poke fun? Why would anyone poke fun at a study about the benefits of walnuts funded by the California Walnut Commission? There isn’t anything funny about malformed sperm, and whatever we can do to improve the shape of men’s sperm gets a thumbs up from me. They should also do a study whether rubbing walnut oil on the scrotum, or even better dipping it in a cup full of the oil.
I do hope that these researchers don’t stop at nuts, and also study the effects of melons on the shape of breasts. Surely, the melon commission of at least one state would be willing to foot at least half the bill for such a research project. The melon study would of course need to be followed by studies about apricots, peaches and cucumbers.</text>

<title>Eat in the middle of the night, be fat</title>
<text>
A new weight and food-intake study has concluded with highly unexpected results. It seems that not eating or munching on crap throughout the night can help fend off weight-gain as well as a bunch of other health issues.
Researchers at the Salk Institute in La Jolla “have come up with something that is a simple alternative to calorie counting.” Satchidanada Panda, the lead researcher of the study used a bunch of mice to compare the effects of eating late at night or munching and snacking throughout the night.
Panda and his team put groups of mice on different eating regimens for 100 days. Animals in two of the groups dined on high-fat, high-calorie chow. Half of them were allowed to eat whenever they wanted, and nibbled on and off throughout the night and day. The other mice had access to food only for eight hours at night, when they were most active.
In human terms, this would be rough: No ice cream while watching “Glee.” No second glass of wine while talking things over with the spouse. Not even a late-night glass of warm milk. (Los Angeles Times)
So it seems that if you starve yourself for 16 hours out of the day, that you’ll be able to maintain a healthy weight, especially if the hours during which you starve yourself are those during the day during which you are least active (like your metabolism).
So with the knowledge gained from this revolutionary new research, you should be able to lose all that unwanted weight. Just stop gorging yourself on cheesecake and chips in the middle of the night as you sit in from of the television watching an episode of Seinfeld for the 27th time.

<title>Bachelor’s degree boosts health</title>
<text>
A new study by the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) found that those with a higher level of education are less likely to be obese, and suffer from chronic diseases, compared to those with only a high school education.
“Highly educated people tend to have healthier behaviors, avoid unhealthy ones and have more access to medical care when they need it,” said Amy Bernstein, the lead author of the report. “All of these factors are associated with better health.” (USA Today)
So this is yet another reason to stay in school kids, because once you have a bachelor’s degree, you’ll be able to make better decisions. All those term papers you researched and wrote about renaissance painters, or the mathematical formulas you memorized will be really helpful when it’s time to pick between a fast food burger, and a home-made dish that is low in fat and salt content.
