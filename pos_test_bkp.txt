<title>McDonalds Janitor Would Like To Thank Everyone Who Tossed Half-Full Cups Of Soda Into Trash</title>
<text>
BLOOMINGTON, INIn an effusive display of gratitude toward the local community, McDonalds custodian Kevin Daniels expressed his sincere thanks Wednesday to every customer who has thrown a half-filled cup of soda into any of his workplaces eight trash receptacles. Honestly, I cant say thank you enough to all of you out there for not finishing your large cups of Coke and Dr. Pepper and then just tossing them into the garbage, especially the ones with a lot of iceI appreciate those the most, said Daniels, noting that the multiple times per day he carries a heavy, sloshing, and oftentimes leaking garbage bag to the dumpster behind the restaurant he realizes just how lucky he is. I also want to give special praise to all of you who attempt to cram your soiled napkins and uneaten bits of burgers and Egg McMuffins into cans that are already overflowing. That truly makes my day. And dont let me forget all the times youve smeared ketchup on the flap of the trash can where it dried and needed to be scraped off. Cant wait to see what wonderful surprises the future has in store. Daniels added that given how happy and grateful he is for all that McDonalds customers do for him every day, he felt that it was extremely selfish of him to be making a full $8 an hour.</text>

<title>Congress Splits Into Male And Female Senators To Discuss Newest Reproductive Bill</title>
<text>
WASHINGTONTo better educate lawmakers on complex reproductive issues while also providing a safe, nonthreatening environment where they can speak up and ask questions without feeling self-conscious, the U.S. Senates 100 members were separated into male and female groups Thursday afternoon prior to arguments on S.1696, the Womens Health Protection Act. Theres always some giggling when the Senate debates a womans right to privacy and choice in reproductive matters, which is okay, but we find that everyones more at ease when they can talk about it with members of their own sex, Senate Sergeant at Arms Andrew B. Willison said as the female senators were led single-file down the hall into the Senate Appropriations Committee Room where they will learn about the proposed legislation from longtime congressional leader Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-MD). This way both the male and female senators can open up and ask anything they want about the bills provisions without fear of embarrassment or teasing. For many elected officials, this is their first real introduction to a womans reproductive rights, so we want to make the process as comfortable for them as possible. Sources confirmed that Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-GA) was given a religious exemption from the discussion after providing a note from his constituents.</text>

This ought to do it, the lonely individual reportedly thought to himself as he placed the fruit in his shopping basket alongside a single pint of milk, which sources confirmed would likely go bad before it was finished. Ill probably have one banana today, maybe the other tomorrow or the day after, soyeah. According to reports, the five bananas remaining in the bunch were purchased by a smiling, cheerful man, who brought them back to a home full of people who love him very much.</text>

As soon as he walked into our apartment, I was completely stunned, said a still unsettled Mast, 32, adding that, aside from the difference in hairstyle and a few inches in height, the two were pretty much identical. The eyes, the nose, their postureits the exact same. They even smile the same way. God, its weird. At press time, Mast was hesitating to return his girlfriends physical advances, as the mental image of her brothers face was still way too fresh.</text>

<title>Working Artist Has Developed Thick Skin For Sound Career Advice</title>
<text>
RICHMOND, VARefusing to let constructive, practical advice get him down, painter-sculptor Marcus Chilton told reporters Wednesday that he has developed pretty thick skin for the countless pieces of sound career guidance that friends and family have attempted to give him over the last five years. To stay focused on your art, you have to just tune people out when they start telling you all the reasonable, highly informed ways you should invest your earnings, start a retirement account, or otherwise supplement your income, said Chilton, adding that while he initially dwelled on the logical, well-thought-out recommendations others offered him, over time he has gradually become impervious to all helpful suggestions and sensible recommendations. Its not easy, but after a while you just have to put on the blinders and shrug off all the insightful advice that, if implemented, would help you live more comfortably and thrive as an artist. Chilton added that he has also developed a thick skin for people who look at the prices of his artwork, scoff, and then walk out of his studio.</text>

Son of a bitch, said Biden as the butterfly knife slipped from his grip, pinwheeled across the stage, and slid beneath the provosts seat. Sorry, everybody. That never happens. Man, I had it going awesome earlier, but Im sweatin balls up here. Damn, that fuckers sharp as hell. Biden, who sources confirmed appeared to be slurping blood from a small wound on his hand, continued the commencement address by heavily quoting from the Whitesnake song Slide It In.</text>

<text>
PITTSFIELD, ILNoting that it would be nice to finally have a little spending cash on hand, both Pittsfield High School junior Marissa Klemp and chemistry teacher Rebecca Murphy applied for the same seasonal waitress position at a local diner, sources confirmed Thursday. Right now, Im borrowing money from my family half the time, so even picking up a few dollars here and there would be great, said the 16-year-old Klemp, echoing the exact sentiments of her 10th-grade science teacher, both of whom hoped to use the money to buy some new clothes before the next school year started. If the tips work out just right, maybe I could even get my own car and wouldnt have to borrow my parents station wagon anymore. I really hope I get this. Murphy and Klemp both went on to express confidence they would land the position, citing their relevant work experience waitressing around town over the previous two summers.</text>

<title>Today's Reader Hot Takes - SportsPickle</title>
<text>
Your point guard scoring 40 points isnt going to win big games. Well, other than this one. Chad F.

What choice did he have? He has to play that well to compensateforhis wardrobe.-- Cassidy J.

Big deal. I remember hearing that theSpurs were washed up years ago. Way to light up a bunch of pathetic old men.Rolf T.

What is the current state of their facial hair? They should keep it like that. Its probably the reason they won.Syl F.

The Red Sox completely sucking is a great retirement gift for Derek Jeter. You cant say the Red Sox arent classy.Pam A.

What heartache their fans must have endured these last 10 games. I cant wait to read the many books published about this difficult era by Boston writers.Dave G.

Its obvious now that Jurgen Klinsmann wants Germany to win the group. Hes a true patriot.Matthew N.

The team will be fine as long as Freddy Adu plays to his potential.Pete L.

Good for him.For all that hes done for American soccer, he deserves to be spared from the drubbing that awaits in Brazil.Melinda P.

Scott Brooks should probably buy some new glasses frames before he gets fired and loses his vision coverage.Leon P.

Its obvious now that Serge Ibaka is the best player in the NBA, which means that LeBron is overrated. Neil B.

LeBron, Kyrie Irving, Anthony Bennett. If their current rate of diminishing returnswith No. 1 overall picks continues, theyll draft a ham sandwich.Philip L.

They should probably start putting up banners for every time they win the draft lottery. Pam D.

Good for them. This will help them cope with getting spurned again by LeBron in free agency.Gary F.

Well, she can play in U.S. Open if she cleans her room first.Sandra L.

I doubt an 11 year-old can handle the brutal hazing that goes on in an LPGA locker room.Keith T.

I hope this doesnt cause her to quit school to play professional golf. Its very important to complete 5th grade.Doug E.

Its exciting because if the Pacers dont win, we can say theyre not an elite team. If the Thunder dont, we can say Durant cant win a ring. If the Spurs dont, we can say theyre washed up. And if the Heat dont, we can say LeBron isnt Jordan. Win, win, win, win.Sal M.</text>

<title>Thunder Agree to Play Games 3 and 4 as Heat Scout Team to Help Spurs Prepare for NBA Finals - SportsPickle</title>
<text>
After a humiliating 35-point Game 2 defeat to the San Antonio Spurs in the Western Conference Finals that saw them fall down 2-0 in the series, the Oklahoma City Thunder have agreed to finish out the series in a manner that will help the Spurs prepare for the Miami Heat in the NBA Finals.

Sometimes you have to know when youre defeated and we are, said Thunder forward Kevin Durant. The Spurs are a much better team. Now its all about coming together as a conference and helping the West get the NBA title back. Were happy to help.

The idea to serve as a scout team for the Spurs in Games 3 and 4 was actually the idea of Thunder head coach Scott Brooks, not San Antonios Gregg Popovich.

He shook my hand after the game, said he knew they were finished and asked me if I was open to the idea. I said sure, said Popovich. But now Im having second thoughs. The Heat are a much better-coached team than OKC. I expect some of the things theyll run now will make them more effective. We could actually lose a game. I hope I didnt get outmaneuvered here by Scott Brooks. That would be really embarrassing.

Thunder point guard Russell Westbrook said he hates the plan.

Im not doing it, he angrily ranted at his locker room after the loss. No way. Their point guard shoots, what  five, six times a game? Ill quit before I play like that.

<title>Heat Ask Lance Stephenson to Deliver Pre-Game Motivational Speech Before Game 5 - SportsPickle</title>
<text>
The Miami Heat have asked Pacers guard Lance Stephenson to address the team before their Game 5 matchup in the Eastern Conference Finals on Wednesday night in Indiana.

Lance is one of those guys who just has a way with words, said Heat star LeBron James. It can be hard to stay motivated after winning back-to-back titles and while playing against a team youre significantly better than. Thats why its so great to have a motivator like Lance around. I cant wait to hear what he has for us before Game 5.

Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra approached Stephenson after Miamis 12-point Game 4 win gave Miami a 3-1 series lead and asked him to speak to his team.

He said: Get away from me. You guys suck, said Spoelstra. So hes already off to a good start. I passed those words along to the guys and they said theyre already getting pumped for Game 5.

Following Miamis Game 3 win, Stephenson said James engaging in trash talk with him was a sign of weakness, and then James responded with 32 points and 10 rebounds to Stephensons 9 points.

The outspoken Pacer says he knows exactly what he plans to say to the Heat before Game 5.

They think Im going to come into their locker room and inspire them by telling them how great and amazing they are? No way, said Stephenson. Im not stupid. Im going to tell them what I really think about them: that theyre overrated and no one respects them and that they only win because theyre lucky. Lets see how they deal with that. The jokes on them.</text>

<title>10 Tips for Flirting (with a No-Hitter) - SportsPickle</title>
<text>
Too many pitchers who want to go all the way with a no-hitter come out in the first inning throwing the ball as hard as they can. That makes no sense. A no-hitter is pitched over nine innings. It wont happen if you blow your load in the first.

Flirting with a no-hitter should be fun. Theres no need to glare and just fire heat the whole time. Plus, that wont work. Someone will eventually square one up and your no-hitter will be gone, off flirting with another pitcher in another city. Instead, vary locations around the plate. Make the ball dip and curve. Change speeds. The flirting will start getting serious in no time.

If the no-hitter is what you want, you need to have control. If you start walking everyone, even without giving up a hit, your pitch count will get too high and youll get pulled from the game before you can even get close to a real chance with the super-hot no-hitter.

Its natural for a pitcher to think after two or three hitless innings: Wow, Ive got a shot at a no-hitter. But dont let that seep into your body language or it will all fall apart. Going all the way with a no-hitter takes time. You have to let it come to you.

Rare is the person who gets a no-hitter who hasnt had help from a fielder or fielders making an amazing play. Be prepared for this. Your fielders are there to help you. If your center fielder makes a highlight-reelcatch, dont be jealous. There is no need to worry. If the no-hitter goes home with anyone, it will be you.

You can get a no-hitter by coating your hand in pine tar and filling your body with PEDs, sure. But is this really the kind of no-hitter that you want?

You may find yourself flirting and getting along well with a no-hitter, only to begin thinking that you have to strike everyone out to seal it. Or you may be a power pitcher who suddenly feels the need to get cutesy. Or, worst of all, your turn in the order may come up and you find yourself sprinting to first base after hitting a routine grounder, deluded into thinking youre a do-everything baseball superstar, only to pull your hamstring. Dont do any of this.

Its rude to talk about no-hittersbehind their back. No-hitters are to be treated with respect. Its between you and it out on the field. If you get a no-hitter, sure, go ahead and tell everyone about it. Make it feel special. But not until then.

Really creepy and inappropriate. Youll get thrown out of the game and your shot at a no-hitter will be over. And probably for a while, too, because youll likely be suspended by the league.

If the flirting has gone on for a long time, you can test the waters to see if youre really going to hook up with this hot no-hitter. Look at the scoreboard. If it shows nine consecutive zeroesbeside the opponents name, followed by a zero below R and H, youve definitely got it. Congratulations. Just be safe. No-hitters may be hard to get, but they also have been with dozens of pitchers. Seriously. Dozens. Who knows what theyre carrying.

<title>The SportsPickle Interview: Tony Reali - SportsPickle</title>
<text>
You have seen Tony Realis face on your TV for more than 10 years. Now you will see his words on your computer screen or mobile device. Its The SportsPickle/Interview with Tony Reali. (And, yes, this is a real interview.)

First off, the obvious question. You have been on Pardon The Interruption for years. Youve hosted your own show, Around The Horn, since 2004. Now youll be on Good Morning America, too.

And youre still just in your mid-30s.

Are you an ELITE sports media personality?

As youve correctly identified, ELITE is on the list of WORDS THAT LEAD TO IMMEDIMUTE!, a list that is expanding faster than the universe thanks to the supernatural ability sportsyappers have to murder human sound. CLUTCH. LOCK. BEAST. CHALK. MUST WIN. PRESENCE OF MIND. HAVING SAID THAT. Et cetera, et cetera, world without end, Amen.

There are tons of things I say every day that deserve shutdown, too, but the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the director to make the mute button work one way.

What does your normal day look like? And when you were just a lowly Stat Boy, did Kornheiser and Wilbon make you run errands for them?

Normal is about to go Russell Westbrook on me so Ill give you the day Ive had for the last 11 years, Memento style. (Memento: on the list of movies of the 00s that rated high but still are somehow underrated. Also: City of God, Children of Men, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.)

ARISE WITH AN ENTHUSIASM ONLY KNOWN TO HARBAUGH-KIND

LOOK AT TWITTER WITH BUOYANCY

READ AROUND THE HORN & PTI GOOGLE DOCUMENTS FOR RESEARCH

ATTACK THE WALK TO WORK (1.09 MILES) WITH PODCASTS (WTF, This American Life, LeBatard Radio, etc etc)

LOOK AT TWITTER WITH HOPEFULNESS

LOOK AT TWITTER SEEKING APPROVAL AND AFFIRMATION

RUN LIKE BEING CHASED, EXERCISE LIKE DONT WANT TO GET HURT

To answer your second question: No to errands, Yes to constant craving companionship.

Does Chris Hardwick give you a percentage of his @midnight hosting salary considering you established the discretionary scoring panel show genre from which he is now profiting?

The one who we both should be tithing to is Drew Carey because Whose Line Is It Anyway? was the first to go full fugazi in its scoring. (Always go full fugazi.) He now owns the Seattle Sounders and hes implemented a pretty cool rule: every four years season ticket holders get to vote on whether they want to re-sign or dump their general manager. If I owned a team Id enact that immediately. And if I ran a league that would be one of the first two things Id put into the Constitution, along with relegation. To me its all about accountability. Which gets us back to the need to score and mute and correct an argument.

Hardwicks father was a pro bowler, so Im sure he can sling it. And he can play the melodica. Cool by me.

You have great power on your show with the ability to mute anyone at any time. How often have you wanted to have this power in real life? Have you ever thought to yourself while dealing with someone annoying: I wish I had my mute button right now?

I. Only. Think. About. This. Every. Day. Imagine a day at work or school with a mute button. Or a date. Or a trip to the DMV. The carnage would be magnificent. Imagine all the interpersonal exchanges we could avoid! We wouldnt have to pretend the earphones in our ears are playing music anymore. It would be noice!

I feel like were letting people down. Like its 1990 and weve all just seen BTTF2 and are like, Wheres My Hoverboard???!!! #WeWerePromisedMuteButtons.

On Good Morning America you will do segments on social media, which appeals to a younger demographic. What is the best way to appeal to the youth? Outside of the obvious, of course: cool hand gestures, bright graphics and sitting backwards on a chair while wearing your hat brim to the side.

I cant pretend to have an answer to your question but I do know weve had a lot of fun on Horn in the last couple of years hearing from our viewers, talking to our viewers, listening to our viewers. Thats what social media is all about anyway, right? Having a voice and having that voice heard. Weve had a great time engaging those voices, pulling the curtain back on our show and giving viewers access to what we do. Im talking Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, our Behind the Horn nuggets, our Youtube Tributes. So, increasing engagement, through access and availability, in a creative way, over multiple platforms  HOW MANY OTHER BUZZWORDS CAN I STRING TOGETHER BETWEEN COMMAS?!  thats what appeals to me about where were going with social media.

Who is on your Mount Rushmore of stat people? I have Bill James, Billy Beane, Nate Silver and then either Stat Boy or Pierre de Fermat.

That is without a doubt the nerdiest question Ive ever heard in my life and I recently asked the panel if they thought NFL GMs invoked the right of prima nocta the night before the draft, so take a bow. Who has a Mount Rushmore of stat people? Stephen Hawking thinks that question lives long and dateless in an Silicon Valley incubator.

You ever notice no one on Rushmore has ears? Seems odd that youd go through the trouble of making graphite eyes and nostril indentations but not have ears.

30 Rock poked fun at Around The Horn with something it called Sports Shouting. 30 Rock has been off the air for more than a year now. Would you care to use this opportunity to dance over its rotting corpse?

No show that lives long enough to make syndication rots. They make gazillions to be forever viewed by Ferris Buellerian children home from school with Casio coughs and clammy trophy hands. Those kids grow up to quote said shows ad nauseam on sportstalk game shows. A worthy existence all around.

I loved 30 Rock. Judah once wore a hat that said Mute Button. Tracy owned the worlds only giraffe basketball team, the New York Necks. That Sports Shouting sketch had a bottom line of soccer scores that read 0-0, 0-0, 0-0, 0-0, 0-0, 0-0, 0-0, 0-0, 0-0, 0-0, 0-0, 0-0, 0-0, 0-0, 0-0, 0-0. Lol out loud.

Theres not really anyone who has a negative word to say about Tony Reali. In fact, when your Good Morning America gig was announced, a lot of people said stuff like: Its great to see one of the good guys do well. Blah blah blah. What are you hiding, Reali?

When I was 10 my Uncle John painted a Christmas mural on my Aunt Barbaras front window. It was a manger scene with shepherds and animals and the three wise men and of course Baby Jesus. I carved curse words onto the animals butts. My mom knew it was me because of the paint under my fingernails.

I had to go to confession for that. I was told I ruined Christmas. So the real question is, How did a convicted holiday ruiner hide in plain sight all these years?

You are a devout Catholic and have even hosted Around the Horn with ashes on your head on AshWednesday. Do you ever fear that when its all over, youll get to the Pearly Gates and find out life is scored by a completely arbitrary system like on Around the Horn?

I have no fears like that. My worry is that when St. Peter sees me he turns to his sidekick and says Time to find out what you messed up, Stat Boy.

<title>A Complete Rundown of Every Team Tony Romo Has Caused to Lose by His Very Presence - SportsPickle</title>
<text>
No need to provide a lot of details here. His history with the Cowboys is well known. The Cowboys get in contention for a playoff spot. Romo begins chucking horrible interceptions. The Cowboys miss the playoffs.

When Romo destroyed them:On March 8, 2014, Tony Romo brought Jason Garrett with him  for extra failing power!  to a Duke-North Carolina basketball game. Shockingly, Duke won the game.

What terrible Romo-esque fate soon befell them:Eight days later, Duke lost the ACC title game to Virginia. Five days after that, the Blue Devils were bounced from the 1st Round of the NCAA Tournament by 14-seed Mercer. Duke had 12 turnovers in the game, including four by supposed star Jabari Parker, who had an awful, Romoian game.

When Romo destroyed them: On January 21, 2014, Romo attended a Dallas Stars game against the Minnesota Wild. In a huge upset over Tony Romo, the Stars won.

What terrible Romo-esque fate soon befell them: In classic Romo-style, on April 27th, the Stars blew a two-goal lead in the final two minutes of a playoff elimination game, and then promptly saw their season end in overtime. So Romo.

When Romo destroyed them:On March 25th, Romo took in an SMU basketball game with fellow harbinger of doom Garrett again. And again Romo wore his Hat of Death. Top seed SMU slipped by Cal in the game by two points to advance to the NIT Final Four.

What terrible Romo-esque fate soon befell them:Despite being a team many thought belonged in the NCAA Tournament  and entering the NIT title game as the favorite at 27-9  just eight days after being visited by Romo, the Mustangs lost to Minnesota on a last-minute three-pointer.

When Romo destroyed them:On April 24th, ESPN ran a graphic in which they accidentally placed Romos headshot where a picture of Pacers head coach Frank Vogel was supposed to go. Accident? Or has Tony Romos fail power spread into the ether, infecting anything and everything it wants, from teams to computer systems? Transcendence.

What terrible Romo-esque fate soon befell them:The Pacers, the No. 1 seed in the East, struggled mightily to get through the first two round of the playoffs against the lowly Hawks and mediocre Wizards. They face the two-time defending champion Heat in the next round.

When Romo destroyed them: On April 28, 2014, Romo brought teammate Jason Witten to a Mavericks playoff game, no doubt looking to expand the Cowboy doom squad beyond just himself and Garrett. He also wore his trademark Hat of Death, with a design very similar to the twig sculptures in True Detective. Is Tony Romo the Yellow King?



What terrible Romo-esque fate soon befell them: The Mavericks lost a fourth quarter lead and fell to their rival, the San Antonio Spurs. At one point, the Mavericks made a terrible turnover just seconds after the TV camera showed Romo, underscoring the vast destructive power of his Romoness. Romo also had a dip in during the game, and will no doubt cause millions of impressionable children to get oral cancer thanks to his example. Thanks a lot, Romo.UPDATE (5.4.14):Including the game Romo attended/cursed, the Mavericks closed out the series by losing three of four games to see their season end in seven games in the 1st Round. In classic Romo fashion, they were crushed by their rival in the elimination game.Thats going full Romo. You never go full Romo.

When Romo destroyed them:On April 5th, Greg Anthony tweeted a picture of himself with Romo and said that Romo, a Wisconsin native, was rooting for the Badgers at the Final Four.Then a photo of Romo in Wisconsin gear surfaced  a picture in which Romo was also wearing his Carcosa Hat of Death.

What terrible Romo-esque fate soon befell them:That very night, Wisconsin lost in the national semifinal, 74-73, on an Aaron Harrison three-pointer with 7 seconds left in the game. A very cruel, Romoian defeat.

When Romo destroyed them:On May 15th, with the Clippers trailing three games to two in their 2nd Round playoff series against the Thunder, Romo showed up for the game in Los Angeles, some 1,400 miles from Dallas. Even worse, he wore his Carcosa Hat of Death. Youll never guess what happened next. No. You will.

What terrible Romo-esque fate soon befell them:ESPNs cameras showed Romo in the 2nd quarter with the Clippers leading 39-23. Immediately  IMMEDIATELY!  the Thunder went on a 13-2 run. The Clippers still maintained an 8-point lead at the half, but completely collapsed in the second half in classic Romo-style, and ended up losing 104-98. Meaning from when Romo was first shown in the crowd, the Clippers lost 81-59.

<title>The 8 Biggest Sports Conspiracy Theories - SportsPickle</title>
<text>
The Theory: Before the 1985 NBA Draft lottery, Stern  perhaps along with other top NBA executives  had the envelope containing the Knicks card frozen so Stern would be able to feel it by touch and know to leave it for the No. 1 overall pick, handing Patrick Ewing to the Knicks.

Why It Might Be True: The NBA has long wanted the big market Knicks to be good, Stern is a New York native, the team was in the toilet at the time and Patrick Ewing was the most desired rookie to come along in years. Plus, Stern has never struck anyone as the most ethical fellow.

Why It Might Be False: If David Stern was in the business of rigging things so the Knicks would be good, he would have had Isiah Thomas killed years ago. In fact, you have to wonder if theres a conspiracy against the Knicks.

The Theory: In light of Michael Jordans six-figure gambling, which may have included bets on NBA games, NBA commissioner David Stern suspended Jordan for the 1993-94 season. But in order to not sully the name of the leagues biggest ticket and bring increased scrutiny on the NBA, Stern allowed Jordan to say he was retiring to try baseball.

Why It Might Be True: Jordans casino gambling during the previous seasons playoffs had drawn attention that Stern did not care for and sports superstars dont usually quit the game they love at age 30 to try a sport they havent played since age 12.

Why It Might Be False: Jordan was at the peak of his career and seen as an athlete with no rival. By choosing baseball over a suspension, he was seen as an athlete who could easily be Kd by Double-A pitchers with 84 mph fastballs. Which is to say: you can make the case that playing baseball hurt his image more than a suspension would have. If theres any Jordan-related conspiracy, its that he sold his soul to Satan before his North Carolina career and then, in exchange, he had to humiliate himself on the Wizards for two years and grow a mustache suggesting his support for Hitler.

The Theory: Pitching against the Yankees in Game 6 of the 2004 ALCS, Red Sox start Curt Schilling put ketchup or red paint on the sock covering his injured ankle to give him an excuse if he pitched poorly  or make himself a hero if he did well.

Why It Might Be True: Schilling so loved attention and sought to self-mythologize himself at every turn, perhaps the theory isnt so absurd. It gained more traction in 2007 when veteran broadcaster Gary Thorne said Boston catcher Doug Mirabelli had admitted that Schillings sock didnt have blood on it, before backing away from the claim.

Why It Might Be False: At the very least, it definitely wasnt ketchup. If it was, David Ortiz would have tried to eat Schilling by the second inning. Heck, Schilling would have tried to eat Schilling.

The Theory: Cal Ripken and his wife have long been friends with Kevin Costner. In August of 1997, while Ripkens consecutive games streak was still intact, Costner was staying at their residence. Cal left for that nights Orioles game, but then came back to the house because he forgot something and walked in on his wife having sex with Costner. Ripken called Orioles owner Peter Angelos to tell him he wouldnt be able to play and Angelos knocked out the power to the stadium.

Why It Might Be True: Ripkens streak sold a ton of tickets for the Orioles and its not inconceivable that Angelos took drastic measures to keep it alive.

Why It Might Be False: Kevin Costner? Unless Mrs. Ripken has terrible terrible terrible taste in movies, theres almost no way she slept with Kevin Costner. Oh, and everyone claims Ripken was at the stadium and in uniform the night the power mysteriously went out. But thats beside the main point, which is, of course: Kevin Costner sucks at acting.

The Theory: Sonny Liston took a dive and was knocked out by a phantom punch from Ali midway through the first round in their 1965 rematch.

Why It Might Be True: There were rumors that Liston had run up major gambling debts to the mafia, so he may have bet against himself in the fight and then lost on purpose to make back what he owed. Also, footage of the Ali jab that floored Liston shows that it barely connected.

Why It Might Be False: It was a punch that barely connected. Yet it connected. And it was thrown by Muhammad Ali. If the average person took a glancing blow from 1965 Muhammad Ali, they would not only be knocked out, they would be decapitated.

The Theory: After the Patriots were busted for filming their opponents signals and practices, commissioner Roger Goodell destroyed all the Spygate evidence because New Englands cheating program was much larger than the public knew.

Why It Might Be True: When the Patriots program was uncovered, Goodell asked the Patriots to turn over all of their illegal tapes and documents  trusting them to do so, despite there being no reason to trust them. Then less than two weeks later, Goodell had all of the evidence destroyed, explaining his reasoning: It was the right thing to do. Thats vague. Maybe it was an attempt to quickly and tidily move past the fact that the winner of three recent Super Bowls had cheated their way to championships.

Why It Might Not Be True: To pull off a legit conspiracy, you have to be pretty smart. Whereas Roger Goodell is an established moron. Destroying the Spygate evidence and continuing to trust the Patriots werent the actions of a conspirator, they were the actions of someone with a very low I.Q.

The Theory: Phoenix Coyotes assistant Rick Tocchet ran a large, nationwide sports gambling ring and Janet Jones, the wife of Wayne Gretzky  who was Phoenixs head coach at the time  was implicated as a major client. But Gretzky was not. Jones took the fall for her husband.

Why It Might Be True: Its hard to believe that Tocchet was running a gambling ring as a side job and taking huge bets from his bosses wife and that Gretzky knew nothing about any of it. It also makes sense that Jones would take the fall, because her husbands image is more important to their long-term financial well-being.

Why It Might Be False: Wives try to keep things quiet from their husbands all the time. Just ask Cal Ripkens wife (theoretically).

The Theory: With the Sacramento Kings leading the Lakers 3-2 in the Western Conference Finals, David Stern ordered the officiating crew to take every possible measure to ensure that the Lakers won.

Why It Might Be True: The Kings are small market, the Lakers are one of the NBAs premier franchises. The Kings in the Finals would equal low ratings, the Lakers in the Finals would equal big ratings. And as for Game 6 specifically, anyone who saw the game  even Lakers homers  would admit that the officiating down the stretch was incredibly biased in favor of the Lakers. Additionally, former NBA official Tim Donaghy has claimed that he was told by an official who worked Game 6 that it was rigged.

Why It Might Be False: Umm  uhh  hmm. Tough one. You know, in all fairness to David Stern and the NBA, this doesnt even belong in a list of conspiracy theories. Because its not just some theory. Its definitely true.

I just hope a serial killer and a years-long cheating scandal that coincided with the only Super Bowl titles in franchise history dont cause people to forget that the Patriots are above reproach.Katie M.

This is just more proof that the police and prosecutors are jealous of how good the Patriots are and are trying to take them down.Donnie M.

I just dont think my new 54-19-9 shirt is as funny as my 18-1 one.Steve L.

Bad news for Boston-area golfers. Milan Lucic will now be usinghis golf clubs to hit people in the crotch.Jon T.

<title>9 Terrible Philly Fan Incidents ... And Their Harmless Explanations - SportsPickle</title>
<text>
Philadelphia fans are known as the most obnoxious, violent and disgusting in all of sports. And while they wear this reputation as a badge of honor, they also  oddly  claim every infamous fan incident has been misconstrued and blown way out of proportion by the "Philly-hating media" and that this stuff "happens everywhere."

 Here's a rundown of all the top (bottom?) Philadelphia fan moments and what really happened.

 

 #9  A drunk Phillies fan vomits all over an 11-year-old girl (April 14, 2010)  Not the whole story, guy. This game was on a Wednesday night. What was this girl doing out late at a game on a school night, huh? All this guy did was give her an up close lesson on the human digestive system. I can't believe we're at the point in this country that we're criticizing people for trying to educate kids.

 #8  Eagles fans cheer as Michael Irvin lay injured and motionless (October 11, 1999)  What?! You LIKE spinal cord injuries or something? Why would we cheer for it? Huh? Why? We were booing, like: "Boooooooooo. Paralysis sucks! Boooooooo." You're the sick one for not booing, man.

 #7  Phillies fans routinely throw batteries at Dick Allen, the team's only black player (1960s)  Sure, don't tell the whole story. The rest of the story is that Allen started wearing a batting helmet while he was in the field at home games. That kept him safer than any other player out there. But did we ever get a single thanks from him? No. But what can you expect from a lazy, ungrateful black.

 #6  Phillies fans throw trash and D-cell batteries at Cardinals outfielder J.D. Drew (August 10, 1999)  Bull crap. There haven't been any D-cell batteries in Philly since the '60s. We chucked them all at that dick Allen.

 #5  A teenage Phillies fan runs onto the field and is Tasered by a police officer (May 3, 2010)  I won't apologize for this. It was for the kid's own safety. He shouldn't be on the field. He could get hit by a battery out there.

 #4  Phillies fans throw glass bottles all over the field in response to an umpire's call (August 21, 1949)  So what. It was a stressful time. World War II and everything.

 #3  Flyers fans attack St. Louis Blues fans and the team's head coach (January 6, 1972)  Ooooooh. Look at the nerd who paid attention in history class. So it wasn't exactly World War II then. You think you're smarter than me, fag?

 #2  Eagles fans boo Santa Claus and pelt him with snowballs (December 15, 1968)  Oh, here we go again with this one. All anyone talks about is Philly fans hitting Santa Claus with snowballs. It was MORE THAN 40 YEARS AGO! GET OVER IT! Plus, that's not the real story. It's like no one cares about accuracy. Here's the really story  A) the guy was not actually Santa Claus; it was a guy in a Santa suit; B) he was drunk; and C) he wan't pelted with snowballs. He was beaten to death with a tire iron. It was my Uncle Mikey who did it. So get your fking facts straight, jack-off.

 #1  Philadelphia installs a jail, judge and court inside Veterans Stadium to deal with unruly Eagles fans (1998) Huh. Hmm. Yeah, well that kind of makes it seems like there might be some sort of problem. Maybe you have a point. Well, you're just lucky we've got stuff like that to protect you, 'cause I'd kick your homo ass. E-A-G-L-E-S, Eagl-(vomits).</text>

<title>MLB Informs Mark Teixeira He Won't be Getting Any Gifts from Teams When He Retires - SportsPickle</title>
<text>
New York Yankees first baseman Mark Teixeira received a letter from MLB headquarters today letting him know that he should not expect a farewell tour full of gifts from opponents when he retires.

Its time to put all of this to an end, read the letter, signed by both commissioner Bud Selig and MLB COO Rob Manfred. Mariano Rivera and Derek Jeter doing this in back-to-back years is quite enough and, lets be honest, youre also not quite on their level.

Teixeira is set to make $22.5 million a season through 2016 from the Yankees, but he is 34, injury prone, and hasnt produced at a high level in several years.

Maybe the teams can give you a free t-shirt or a discount at their clubhouse stores, but there will be no on-field ceremonies, states the letter. Please dont expect that. Its not happening.

Teixeira, who is nursing a stiff wrist, says he was disappointed to receive the letter.

You start to think every Yankee gets these, and Ill admit I was hoping to get a farewell tour one day, he said. I had already picked out a place in my house where I planned to display the benches made out of bats, motorcycles, guitars and bookcases made out of baseballs. I guess Ill just make it another guest bedroom now.

Despite nixing a Teixeira farewell tour, MLB officials admit there will probably have to be one for Ichiro, a far better player than Rivera or Jeter, and one with a huge following internationally.

Ah, shit. Youre right, said Manfred. But still none for Teixeira. Or for Sabathia. And definitely not A-Rod.</text>

<title>Jeff Samardzija: "It's comforting to know that pitcher wins are an outdated stat" - SportsPickle</title>
<text>
Chicago Cubs pitcher Jeff Samardzija has put up Cy Young numbers nearly a third of the way through the season. In 10 starts, he has a 1.46 ERA and 1.09 WHIP and is on pace to log nearly 250 innings. On the other hand, Samardzija is still winless at 0-4.

But the 7-year Cubs veteran says he is completely fine with not winning a single game all year.

Pitcher wins mean almost nothing, he said. Like the RBI or valuing batting average over on-base percentage, I know thatpitcher wins are a relic of old-time baseball. And I say that to myself before and after every pitch I throw. Pitcher wins mean nothing. Pitcher wins mean nothing. Pitcher wins mean nothing.

Cubs general manager Theo Epstein, one of the pioneers of advanced statistics in baseball, has also made a point to remind Samardzija of the irrelevancy of pitcher wins.

I leave notes in his locker, said Epstein. I also text him a lot about it. Any way I can help the guys understand their role and the sport of baseball better, Im happy to do that. I dont want him to get too upset about wins and losses. Or, well, no wins and all losses in his case. Basically, Im afraid he could snap at any moment and kill everyone on the team.

Samardzija is scheduled to pitch against the San Francisco Giants next and says he hopes to have a shot at a win if I pitch a 17-inning perfect game.

The performance of the former Notre Dame wide receiver star is one of the few bright spots so far this season for the last-place Cubs, but Epstein believes good things are on the way.

I just need to convince the rest of baseball that team losses are an outdated way to measure performance, he said. If I can do that, well have a dynasty here.

<title>Nick Saban: "We're just going to show up at the BCS title game anyway" - SportsPickle</title>
<text>
Alabama has accepted a bid to play in the Sugar Bowl against Oklahoma on January 2nd, but head coach Nick Saban announced today that the Crimson Tide will also show up on January 6th at the BCS championship game unless someone thinks they can stop us.

Congrats to Florida State on being undefeated, but I mean come on, said Saban, smirking. Who have they played? Of course, I respect their opportunity to play in the BCS title game and play they will, as long as they can get on the field through the tunnels which will be blocked by Alabama linemen. I guess well see whos on the field at kickoff.

Alabama won the last two BCS championships and missed out on another undefeated season by a single score when Auburn ran back a missed field goal attempt as time expired in the final game of the season.

No intelligent person thinks we shouldnt still have an opportunity to defend our national titles because of one fluke play in one game, said Saban to the assembled press. Does anyone intelligent think that here? Show of hands. Who here is a moron? I thought so. No one thinks that. Now, am I willing to be gracious here and give Florida State an opportunity to play? I sure am. I just hope my boys can put up more of a fight than  Duke? Duke was it? They have a football team? Wow. Those shit conferences are full of amazing trivia.

Florida State head coach Jimbo Fisher says his team fully expects to take the field and compete in the BCS title game against Auburn.

So Nick plans to make us get past his linemen to play in the game? said Fisher. The same guys who were on the field for that game-ending field goal return against Auburn? Yeah, I think well be okay. They looked pretty easy to get past.

<title>Johnny Manziel Says He Will Tone Down His Act Per the Valued Advice of National Sports Columnists - SportsPickle</title>
<text>
Texas A&M quarterback Johnny Manziel said he is ashamed by his behavior in his season-opening game on Saturday and claims he will tone down his behavior after reading several columns about himself in newspapers and online.

The Heisman winner was forced to sit out the first half of the Aggies season opener against Rice due to his role in an autographs-for-pay scandal, but returned for the second half and threw three touchdowns on 6-for-8 passing for 94 yards. His brash behavior in the game, however, making gestures alluding to cash and signing autographs, got most of the attention.

A lot of the Rice players were yapping at me and I was just trying to have fun with it, said Manziel. But then I happened to be online after the game and  wow. I really let some sports columnists down. Im very sorry. Sorry and ashamed. I have to do better.

The quarterback said he read more than a dozen columns chiding his behavior and each one made more and more sense to him. Their takes were strong and true.

Im not just a college quarterback trying to win games and have fun, he said. I am an avatar for the downfall of our society. I know that now. I also understand that kids were watching that game, and those kids may never recover from seeing my behavior. Ive tainted them and, for that, I am very sorry. Thankfully, the men and women who wrote these columns cared enough about me to make their thoughts known. I just wish I could thank all of them individually. I will never forget their constructive criticism and advice.

With another game fast approaching against Sam Houston State, Manziel said he will try to play with honor and dignity.

I will keep my emotions in check and comport myself with the utmost decorum and solemnity, he said. I know how important that is now, thanks to the men and women of the sports media. I just wish more of my fellow college athletes would hear them out. They are so generous with their advice.

Manziel said he is also considering quitting football and going into sports media so I can really make a positive impact on the world.</text>

<title>Thunder Credit Turnaround to Playing in Honor of Deceased Teammate Serge Ibaka - SportsPickle</title>
<text>
The Oklahoma City Thunder were left for dead after falling down two games to none to the Spurs in the Western Conference Finals, getting thoroughly beaten in each game. But the team responded with two wins of its home at home to even the series, including a dominating Game 4 performance  and the Thunder players to a man say they know the reason for the turnaround.

Obviously, were playing for the memory of Serge [Ibaka], said forward Kevin Durant. He got hurt and passed on, and I think the sadness over that really hurt us in Games 1 and 2. But then before Game 3 we decided: You know what? Serge may be dead, but he would want us to still play hard in his honor. And thats exactly what weve done.

The 6-foot-10, 24 year-old Ibaka had been a big part of Oklahoma Citys success in recent years, but he was declared out before the start of the conference finals.

I really didnt think his calf injury was that bad, said point guard Russell Westbrook. But I guess one thing led to another. Complications or whatever. And then he was gone. Gone too soon. But I like to think hes up there in heaven looking down on us and smiling.

Ibaka had 15 points, 7 rebounds and 4 blocks in Game 3 against the Spurs, and followed that up with 9 points, 8 rebounds and 3 blocks in Game 4.

I like to think thats how Serge would have wanted me to play, said Ibaka. I hope I made him proud.
