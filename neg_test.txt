<title>Why can't Nigerians watch the country's biggest movie?</title>
<text>
Editor's note: Nigerian Biyi Bandele is the director of "Half of a Yellow Sun" (2013), a film based on a novel by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie about the Biafran war, in which over a million people died. The opinions expressed in this article are solely his.

(CNN) -- When I heard last month that the Nigerian Film and Video Censors Board, headquartered in Abuja, had indicated that it would be unable to issue certification for "Half of a Yellow Sun" in time for the film's release date, I naturally assumed, at first, that what we were faced with was nothing more sinister than another instance of the typical, if frustrating, culture of wilful incompetence that we'd grappled with during the making of the film -- while shooting the film in Nigeria two years ago, there were times when we felt ensnared in impenetrable jungles of red tape, when we would be given the go-head by one arm of the government only to find our path blocked by the other arm.

I had no reason to assume that there might be anything more to it than that. I had no reason to assume, for instance, that the inability of the board to issue the film with a certificate might actually be a clumsy, heavy-handed ban in all but name.

After all, when the movie had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival last autumn, amongst the entourage of Nigerians who flew in to Toronto for the occasion was Patricia Bala, director-general of the Nigerian censorship board.

Bala had arrived in Toronto -- I was told -- with several of her colleagues from the censor's office. I know for a fact that they watched the movie. I do not know for a fact that they all liked it. I cannot say if any one of them stood up when, as the end credits rolled, the audience rose and gave the film three standing ovations. But I do know that Bala was gracious enough to tell us after the screening how much she loved the movie. At no point did she express any reservations about the contents of the film.

It is now nearly eight months since Bala and her board first saw the movie in Toronto and a few weeks since she and her board have failed to issue "Half of a Yellow Sun" the certification that it needs -- that the law requires it obtains before it can be shown in cinemas in Nigeria.

In those several days I've been assailed -- on Twitter, Facebook, and by email -- with rumors, innuendos, half-truths, and downright lies, disseminated sometimes directly from the censorship board (they have issued at least one press statement), about why "Half of a Yellow Sun" still hasn't been issued with a ratings certificate.

The board claims that is has not banned the film but certain aspects of it "have some unresolved issues which have to be sorted out in accordance with the law and laid down regulations."

It has been rumored that FilmOne, the Nigerian distributors of "Half of a Yellow Sun," might have been late in submitting the film for certification. Not true. Most films that are screened in Nigerian cinemas are shown to the censor only a day or two before the films open to the paying public. In documentations that have been shown to me, there are instances even of movies being shown to the censor days after the movies had officially opened to the public. "Half of a Yellow Sun" was scheduled to open on April 25. It was submitted to the censorship board at least two weeks earlier.

I've also heard tell that the censorship board's inability to make a decision about a ratings certificate for my film has been brought upon it because of a sudden concern that a movie that depicts scenes from the Biafra war might provoke "tribal violence" in a country that has in recent months been besieged with terrorist bombings and profoundly shaken by the abduction of over 200 school girls by Boko Haram.

Since the Toronto premiere those many months ago, I've seen "Half of a Yellow Sun" at other film festivals in all corners of the globe. And Nigerians being the ubiquitous people that we are have been present in the audiences -- quite often in great numbers -- at each of these festivals.

I am yet to meet a single Nigerian who has seen the film who came out of the cinema thinking that they had just seen a film that would incite anyone to violence. If anything, more than once, I've been accosted by cinema-goers -- some Nigerian, but really, people of all races -- who have been profoundly moved by the experience of watching the film. The refrain I've heard from them is, war is nasty, isn't it.

Whether or not the film eventually gets a ratings certificate in Nigeria, "Half of a Yellow Sun" will be seen by millions of Nigerians. The question is: will they be allowed to see it in their local cinemas and on legally acquired DVDs or will they be forced to watch it on pirate DVDs and through illegal downloads? If the biggest film that's ever been made in Nigeria is available to Nigerians only in bootleg form, the censorship board will be doing to the Nigerian film industry what Boko Haram is trying to do to Nigeria: drive a stake through its heart. I sincerely hope they both fail.

<title>A bonny horse who loves to race  CNN World Sport</title>
<text>
All too often we see a favorite endlessly hyped up before a race only to disappoint on the bigday.

Well, that certainly was not the case in this years Kentucky Derby.

California Chrome, the flashy chestnut colt, was the focus of intense pre-race attention in the week leading up to the Derbynot only because of his impressive credentials but also because of his story.

Everybody loves an underdog and this bargain basement horse, in the purple and green DAP silks with a green bucking donkey motif on the back, belonged to two regular guys enjoying their first foray into the complex world of horse breeding.

Steve Coburn and Perry Martin each bought a share in a relatively inexpensive filly racehorse, Love The Chase, who won one race in six starts.

When the partnership decided to cut their losses and sell the sweet but slow filly, Coburn and Martin opted to buy out their partners for a value of $8,000 and send her to the breeding barn.

Selecting a stallion to cover your mare is often a labor intensive, almost mathematic process depending on what type of horse you are trying to produce.

For reasons best known to them, the pair settled on Lucky Pulpit for a fee of $2,000, himself an adequate racehorse who never fulfilled his maximum potential due to illness.

Eleven months later, out came the foal that would come to be named California Chrome - the name was pulled out of a hat of suggestions made by the owners and their families. Seabisquik was also in the mix.

When they sent the horse, now a three-year-old, to veteran trainer Art Sherman, the rookie owner-breeders told the ex-jockey that this would be his Kentucky Derby winner.

To cut a long story short, under the watchful care of his veteran trainer, this bonny horse who loves to race progressed so well that he wound up an unlikely favorite for the most famous race in the world.

And then he won it.

Going back to the colors worn by his Mexican jockey Victor Espinoza, the DAP stands for Dumb Ass Partnerships - so named by Coburn and Martin when those around them saidonly a "dumb ass" would buy California Chrome's mother Love The Chase.

While it's probably not the classiest name around, it does prove that for all the money and time spent on trying to breed the perfect racehorse, sometimes it's just down to luck.</text>

<title>Extreme IPO! GoPro plans $100 million offering</title>
<text>
The camera maker revealed plans Monday to raise $100 million in an initial public offering, as well as financial results showing several years of surging growth.

GoPro made its IPO plans known earlier this year but, because it filed confidentially, hasn't opened its books until now. The company's sales reached $986 million last year, more than four times its 2012 total, while profits hit $60.6 million, nearly doubling.

That pace has moderated a bit in 2014. GoPro recorded $236 million in sales for the first quarter, down from $255 million a year prior, while profits dropped to $11 million from $23 million in 2013.

The company plans to trade on the Nasdaq under the symbol "GPRO." That's a small victory for the exchange, which, despite its tech focus, has lost out to the New York Stock Exchange on offerings from companies like Twitter and Box.

GoPro rose to fame with its action cams -- small, weatherproof, mountable video cameras that offer excellent video quality and battery life considering their size. Thrill seeker Felix Baumgartner famously used a GoPro camera to record his free fall from space in 2012.

The cameras were initially marketed for extreme sports, but other hobbyists have been quick to find new uses for them. Drone enthusiasts, for example, have found the GoPro ideal for mounting on their flying vehicles and capturing footage from the skies.

But GoPro is also facing increased competition from some unlikely places. As companies like Google ( the Galaxy Gear watch, more people will be donning wearable cameras -- a market GoPro has largely cornered thus far.

Foxconn -- the Chinese manufacturer best known for assembling iPhones and iPads -- invested $200 million in the company in late 2012, giving it a 9% stake. At the time, the investment valued GoPro at about $2.25 billion.</text>

<title>Airbnb, Uber under attack in Barcelona</title>
<text>
FORTUNE -- Barcelona would seem like the perfect market for web-based collaborative consumption firms like Airbnb and Uber. Spain's second city is a hip tourist destination with a large population of young foreigners and a burgeoning tech sector.

And up until now, it has been. Depending on the month, Barcelona is Airbnb's third or fourth largest market, tied with London behind New York and Paris. And while Uber only entered the city in April, it was greeted with fanfare.

But Barcelona has become a headache for the popular residence and ride-sharing platforms, ground zero in a fight over how collaborative consumption should be regulated and taxed.

Taxi drivers have asked Barcelona's local government to shut down Uber because of what they see as unfair competition from unlicensed, untaxed drivers. Hotel unions have made similar complaints about Airbnb, and local residents have objected to the proliferation of unlicensed tourist apartments.

And the government has begun to listen.

"All this activity has to be legalized and be moved in the tax-paying world so as not to create unfair competition," says Barcelona Second Deputy Mayor Snia Recasens.

At a recent e-commerce conference at Barcelona's IESE Business School, representatives of Airbnb and Uber played down the conflict as the typical fuss when a disruptive business enters a heavily regulated industry. In reality, they said, their services can help the city and aid these sectors.

Jeroen Merchiers, Airbnb's Barcelona-based general manager for Spain and Portugal, said that last year rentals through his firm had a $128 million impact in Barcelona, much of which helped struggling locals: 77% of the hosts rented out one room in their home and earned an average of 220 euros a month, he said, most of which went toward basic needs.

"In southern Europe, people are struggling. Fifty three percent of the hosts say the money they make as a host allows them to stay in the room or house where they are," he says. "Thousands of families are using this to make ends meet."

For his part, Uber's general manager for North and West Europe, Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty, said that he understood the taxi drivers' fears but argued that Uber's growth was part of a structural transition away from personal cars, which, in the long run, would help taxis.

"Very often, we hear that Uber is competing with taxis, and I think when you focus on that, you miss the bigger picture, which is the trend to more shared resources, which could be taxis," he says. "Guys who drop their car use taxis more than ever."

In recent years, Barcelona has experienced a huge tourist boom -- in fact, tourism now accounts for some 14% of the local economy -- and is looking to organize it in a way that will be profitable without destroying the city's identity. A growing number of locals have begun to complain about rowdy tourists staying in unlicensed rentals, especially in the city 's historic old city, the Ciutat Vella (a documentary on YouTube, Bye Bye Barcelona, traces the downside of the city's tourist boom).

"We have 1.6 million inhabitants here and 27 million tourists visit us," says Recasens. "What is evident in this ratio is we have to find some agreement between locals and visitors."

On May 2, the city put into place a temporary freeze on new tourist housing licenses, which are required for people who want to rent out their apartments. There are about 8,000 in the city, including 604 in the Ciutat Vella.

According to Recasens, the city aims to have a new urban plan in place in July, when it will reopen licenses in neighborhoods that aren't saturated. She said the city also plans to open a tourist apartment hotline, where locals can call to complain about problem rentals. Unlicensed tourist apartments could be fined up to 90,000 euros.

The city has run into conflict with Airbnb over these kinds of regulations. While a new regional rule requires companies offering tourist rentals to post their license number on online listings, Airbnb does not require its hosts to do so, arguing that it does not offer the rentals directly.

"We're a technology platform that puts two people in touch. We don't have the capacity to verify who is complying with the law," Merchiers says. "But every host signing up on Airbnb confirms that he understands local regulations. It's up to him."

That's not enough for Recasens.

"They hide in a judicial limbo or behind laws that protect ecommerce," she says. "It's not fair that one can hide behind e-commerce in order to not comply with the law."

Uber has run into problems with the city because it puts ride-share clients in contact with unlicensed drivers who compete with taxi drivers who must pay for licenses that cost some 100,000 euros.

"We have thousands of taxi drivers who live from their taxi licenses," says Recasens. "I can understand that some people want to make a little extra [on Uber] because they're having a tough time, but they have to understand that this is unfair competition with families that have the same right to earn a living."

After the local taxi union complained, the regional government of Catalonia opened an investigation into Uber and noted that unlicensed taxis could be fined up to 2,000 euros. It is not Uber's first problem in Europe: Paris briefly instituted a 15-minute wait time on Uber-like services, and in April, a court in Brussels banned the service there.

Right now, the services are trying to keep the peace by finding common ground with their competitors.

"Why does a taxi license cost that much?" asks Uber's Gore-Coty.

Similarly, Merchiers of Airbnb points to regulation as the issue. "What we're voting for is that instead of overregulating one sector and under-regulating others is that everyone has fair regulation," he says.</text>

<title>America's linguistic melting pot  Global Public Square</title>
<text>
For more Last Look, watch GPS, Sundays at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. ET on CNN



Here at GPS, we love deep data dives. We also revel in the fact that America continues to be the melting pot that it has always been. So we were interested to see a piece on Slate.com last week analyzing the most common languages spoken in each state using U.S. census data.

This first map is predictable  other than English, Spanish is the most spoken language in almost all U.S. states. But watch what happens when you remove Spanish from the equation. Now there is the melting pot.

In Michigan, Arabic clocks in as the third most commonly spoken language.

It's Vietnamese in four states  Texas, Oklahoma, Nebraska and Washington.

It's a Filipino language called Tagalog in Hawaii, California, and Nevada.

In four states, its Native American languages.

And in 16 states, it's German. If you're surprised at that number, according to recent census measures of countries of ancestry, people of German heritage outnumber all other groups in the United States  even Irish! Remember, until World War I, by some accounts, German was the second most widely spoken language in all of the United States. And that tradition seems to linger.</text>

<title>Friends kayak 300 miles in 15 days on Rock River</title>
<text>
Traveling more than 300 miles in 15 days, three friends made their way down the Rock River to have some fun and raise money for their schools athletic program.

Jacob Boucher and Garrett Feik of Aledo, Illinois and Jon Gress of Pekin, Illinois started their journey from the Horicon Marsh in Wisconsin and ended their trip around 6:00 p.m. May 27, 2014 at Sunset Marina in Rock Island.

We are the first ones to do the trip consecutively from what Ive been told, said Gress.

Just wanted to do something fun before we had to grow up, said Boucher.

The men also used the trip as an opportunity to raise money for Maranatha Baptist Universitys new mascot, the Sabercats, and for new uniforms for the athletic programs, and new paintings for the gym floors.

Along the river, the three were greeted by supporters. They camped for all but two of the night on their trip, and for at least seven of the days, meals were provided to them.

We never would have thought that so many people wouldve helped us out, said Boucher.

The people are what really made the trip so special and thats something that we really didnt anticipate going into this trip, said Gress.

<title>23 dead after al Qaeda attacks in southern Yemen</title>
<text>
(CNN) -- At least 12 government troops and 11 attackers were killed after al Qaeda fighters riding in more than 20 trucks raided government institutions in the southern province of Hadramout Friday night.

The Defense Ministry confirmed the fatalities to government troops, adding that 11 more were injured in the attacks, and four of them were in critical condition.

Eyewitnesses in Seyoon district told CNN that more than 100 al Qaeda fighters attacked nine different governmental institutions, including the national security and police headquarters, and two strategic military bases.

"The militants waited until nightfall and burned down all the government institutions they controlled," said Ali Ba Obaid, an eyewitnesses.

He said that government reinforcements arrived two hours after the militants had taken control of the institutions.

"Hundreds of government forces led by the air force and special forces forced the terror militants to evacuate" early Saturday morning, "but they left after destroying everything," he said.

"The latest al Qaeda defeat in Seyoon is strong proof that their ability to control areas in Yemen are very limited," the official told CNN on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to talk to media.

He said that two of the terrorists killed in the clashes were Saudi.

The attacks came a little more than a month after Yemen launched a military offensive against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula amid an uptick in violence in the capital.</text>
