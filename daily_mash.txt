<title>Dreadlocked caucasians demand to face more discrimination</title>
<text>
WHITE people with dreadlocks are not facing as much discrimination as they would ideally like, it has emerged.

Matted hair owners claim that other than being broadly defined as crusties and trustafarians they were going largely unnoticed by mainstream society.

25-year-old Brighton resident Tom Logan, who prefers to be called Boz, said: I cant remember the last time someone shouted something in the street, and even then it was something non-commital like have a bath mate.

Cant they see that I dont subscribe to their stupid materialist values, and am in fact a threat to the status quo?

These dreads took years to grow, theyre bloody itchy, and right now Im feeling like it was all a waste of time.

Dreadlocked Emma Bradford, aka Trouser, said: Ive been able to get a series of jobs, nothing fancy admittedly and mostly in organic cafes but still Im consistently being treated like a normal, unremarkable person.

Which Im not, obviously, because Ive got unusual hair and a rusty van with pictures of animals on it. Also I can stay upright on a unicycle for up to three minutes at a time.

She added: Clearly someone needs to oppress me. Maybe they could bring back punks just so they can chase us around town centres.</text>

<title>Should I scissor-kick my brother-in-law in the face?</title>
<text>
My brother-in-law and I havent been getting on lately. Ive been trying to avoid it, but I fear hes something of a big-headed braggart, obsessed with material wealth and with unhealthy attitudes towards women and authority. Should I sit down and talk to him calmly about it or should I just cut to the chase and scissor-kick him in the face?

It sounds like you have anger management issues and might benefit from spending time in Mrs OReillys sunshine sessions. Whether you have ADHD, are located somewhere on the autism spectrum, or have simply consumed too many Fruit Shoots, if youre caught kicking off then its the muted colours of the Sunshine room and Enya on a constant loop. Eventually the red mist will clear and youll be able to harmlessly express your anger through the medium of Play-Doh. By the time youve finished the dolphin jigsaw puzzle youll feel calm and collected enough to go about your business in a non-violent manner. Just dont set yourself off again by agreeing to play a round of Buckaroo.</text>

<title>The most powerful wedgie ever performed</title>
<text>
The most important qualities for a leader are a belief in organic farming, a disdain for modern architecture and a talent for watercolour landscapes. Unfortunately Ive been caught slagging off Vladimir Putin as a man with none of these attributesand even compared him unfavourably to Hitler, who at least did the watercolours. Now hes comingto get me. Im scared.

Theres nothing worse than knowing the biggest bully in school is gunning for you and has told everyone that when he finds you he will cut you clean in half with the most powerful wedgie ever performed on a human being. You are forced to change your hairstyle, wear dark glasses and avoid the playground at all costs. The worst part about it all is living in a constant state of high alert, never too sure when the fateful blow will fall. Best thing to do is face the situation head on rather than spend the rest of the school year hiding in the PE cupboard at playtime. Stand tall, dont let the bully intimidate you and, most importantly of all: go commando.</text>

<title>Hen parties embark on lifeless parody of fun</title>
<text>
THOUSANDS of hen parties are preparing for raucous yet entirely fake fun.

As the hen party season begins, groups of women are booking hotel rooms in Bath where they will pretend to enjoy doing outrageous but strangely dull things.

31 year-old bride-to-be Emma Bradford said: We had something called a pamper day then we put on special t-shirts, each printed with a single word that summarises our personality.

Mine said cocklover which was a bit awkward as my nan was with us.

Then I was given a list of tasks, like kissing a bald mans head, something involving a dildo, etcetera etcetera.

Everyone was laughing a lot, but in a quite forced way because the whole experience felt really empty, although nobody acknowledged that. However we will look back at the photographs and tell ourselves it was amazing.

Bradfords sister-in-law Nikki Hollis said: I remember dancing in a big group to 80s music. My arms felt really tired and I just wanted to be in bed.

There was a married estate agent who kept poking me in the back with his boner.

One of Emmas work friends said a racist thing to a shopkeeper, I lost my mobile and Donna the mental one turned out to have legitimate mental health problems.

The evening ended abruptly when we all had a massive argument about nothing.</text>

<title>Voters do walk of shame</title>
<text>
BRITISH voters have woken up this morning mortified about what they got up to at yesterdays elections.

At polling stations across the country millions threw caution to the wind to indulge in their base desires in the privacy of a voting booth.

Voter Wayne Hayes said: UKIPs been courting me for months, flattering me about how kissably British I am and the great job theyd give me and the next thing I know Im filling all three of their boxes. I feel so dirty.

Hes in the kitchen now, farting and shouting abuse at Radio 4. Ill slip out the bathroom window before he comes back upstairs and starts whispering to me about gypsies again.

I just hope my Polish wife Weronikacant smell the fags and Theakstons Bitter on me when I get home.

Polling station volunteer Margaret Hollis said: You could hear people whooping in the booths as they did terrible things to their ballot papers.

One man came out, leered at me and said I wouldnt believe what hed just done to my country. This is a church hall, the filthy beggar.

Others used the election to mend broken relationships, with many left-wingers ending disastrous flings with the Liberal Democrats to go back to old flames.

Labour supporter Nikki Hollis said: I should never have left my boring, vaguely dishonest party for such a set of spineless creeps.

Though I dont half fancy the Greens. They can renationalise my railways anytime.</text>

<title>Nigel Farages guide to voting UKIP</title>
<text>
GOODmorning and congratulations on making the best decision of your life  youre going to vote UKIP.

But how exactly do you do that? Is it true that UKIP are so outside the political system that you can register your vote by making a deliciously politically incorrect remark in a public place?

Sadly not, though dont let that stop you. Just follow the steps below:

Head out to your local polling station, but be wary. Primary schools are hotbeds of trendy liberal Marxism, and that wall display could be multicultural propaganda.

Dress smartly to act as an ambassador for your party. Men should wear a blazer, tie and biscuit-colouredtrousers. Women should be well-groomed and not vote.

Do not betempted by false UKIPs like an Independence in Europe, No2EU and the English Democrats. They are serpents sent to sway you from the path of righteousness.

Make your cross in the box next to your local UKIP candidates name. Dont worry if you dont recognise it hell soon be on the TV news for saying things about gays.

Dont add another four lines to your cross to make a cheeky little swastika. This counts as spoiling your ballot and is a major reason why right-wing parties underperform in elections.

Finally, enjoy yourself! Take your time, drink in the surroundings and savour the moment. After all, youre never going to vote UKIP again.</text>

<title>Queen to live as a horse</title>
<text>
THE Queen has formally announced that she willspend her retirement living in stables as a horse.

Shewill spend most of her time standing motionless on all fours, occasionally visiting the stable door so that animal lovers can stroke her nose.

A footman will bring a daily nosebag but her only social interaction will be with horses, the creatures she has always loved the most.

The Queensaid: Those who have observed me over the years will have noticed that the only time I have ever broken into anything resembling a smile is in horse-related circumstances.

I have always envied horses. A horse never had to make small talk with Robert Mugabe, endure the vacuous attentions of gawping sycophants waving stupid little flags or resist the temptation of poking Tony Blair in the eye with a silver toasting fork.

I will always hold my family in a certain regard but if any of them, particularly the eldest boy, try to approach my stables, guards are instructed to shoot them in the kneecaps.

My message is essentially this  if you have fewer than four legs, fuck off.

As for all my money, I shall use it as bedding.</text>

<title>Students demand end to sunshine-revision link</title>
<text>
BRITISH students have asked for their exams to be moved to when it is dark and pissing down.

The proposal has been signed by more than 60,000 students revising for GCSEs, A-levels and university qualifications while gazing longingly out of windows.

Psychology student Francesca Johnson said: Were young, energetic and attractive. This weather needs us out there playing volleyball in halter tops.

Instead were stuck inside reading textbooks, communicating with our equally isolated peers via shout-outs on Radio One.

The terrible irony is we are almost completely idle for the rest of the year.

The National Union of Students has lodged an official complaint with the UKs educational institutions, along with a motion to change the word revising to vising because nobody did the work first time around.

A spokesman for the Confederation of British Industry said: Do you think employers really want staff who know when the Corn Laws were abolished, or how to calculate the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle?

The real point of education is to train workers who can ignore every natural human instinct to drop everything the minute the sun is out.

Good luck to all the kids doing exams out there. Work hard now.</text>

Britain wondering what weak-willed, power-hungry Conservative Party will do now

BRITAIN is wondering what impact UKIPs electoral success could possibly have on the Conservative Party.

As Nigel Farages xenophobic, anti-feminist, anti-gay marriage movement unseated dozens of Tory councillors, experts believe the Conservatives response will be anyones guess.

Political consultant Julian Cook said: Will David Cameron lurch to the right in a craven attempt to win over a band of angry dimwits?

Or will he adopt a series of populist, right-wing positions in the hope they will appeal to millions of belligerent cretins?

Perhaps he will do neither and simply ramp up the xenophobic, anti-liberal rhetoric in a bid to attract patriotic simpletons and traditional British nincompoops.

Im certainly not putting any money on it, and Im quite the expert.</text>

<title>Humans closer to ultimate sedentary experience</title>
<text>
THE growing popularity of watching other people play computer games is a step forward for zero-effort entertainment, experts believe.

Experts believe Googles$1bn valuation of a website where users watch strangers playing video games is part of a trend towards the ultimate non-participatory leisure experience.

SoftwaredeveloperNikki Hollis said: By comparison to looking at other peoples games of Pokemon, watching normal telly is a mental challenge on a par with reading War & Peace in a single sitting.

Right now the question is how to make entertainment more suited to inert people.

In the next Grand Theft Auto, characters will simply complete missions on their own, leaving the player free to go to sleep.

LucasArts is planning a game based on Star Wars Part VII which involves players watching other players controlling Han Solo during a long bath. So youll just be watching someone occasionally hitting X to top up the hot water.

Hollis said companies were now developing completely new, effort-free entertainment technology, such as the Sony WatchBall, a small plastic ball thattrundles around a room which can be watched or completely ignored.

She added: Microsoft is hoping to get a share of the market with a televisionthat constantly explains whats going on while tucking the viewer up under a large duvet.

Our only limit is our laziness. In 2030 well probably entertain ourselves by floating semi-conscious in a vat of liquid anaesthetic while listening to Enya.</text>

Couples that watch TV in bed have better vicarious sex lives

COUPLES with televisions in the bedroom enjoy better and more frequent sex by proxy, it has emerged.

Households with bedroom TVs experienced more than three times as many sex acts at one remove than those who read books or surfed the internet.

Housewife Susan Traherne said: Were watching Scandal, True Blood and Californication like a couple of wild-libidoed maniacs until four in the morning. We just cant get enough.

Professor Henry Brubaker, of the Institute for Studies, said: Sex in real life cant live up to the sex in movies and on TV.

It rarely has a smoky saxophone soundtrack, let alone moonlight casting slatted shadows on two writhing naked bodies on perfect dishevelled white sheets.

Perhaps there was a place for first-person intercourse before HD and Blu-Ray, but certainly its over now.</text>

Pretty girl in summer dress is most depressing sight imaginable

AN attractive young woman in a pretty summer dress is putting men and woman alike in a terrible mood.

The unidentified pretty girl was described by onlookers as having an utterly carefree manner. She exuded youth, beauty and an innocent sensuality.

36-year-old Tom Logan said: She was like a lovely living statue or some nymph from Welsh mythology, a beautiful mystical thing.

However I am tired, old and miserable. She would rather die than glance at me.

I hate myself and my tired lust.

Office worker Emma Bradford said: I love her dress but I would definitely look a bit fat in it.

By comparison I am a massive, sweaty sow. To hell with everything, Im going to buy the biggest possiblebag ofHaribo and consume itin the toilet at work.

Father-of-two Stephen Malley said: I love my family but part of me now wants to abandon them. Summer is such a downer.</text>

<title>UKIP councillors told they cant withdraw Doncaster from EU</title>
<text>
NEWLYelected UKIP councillors have discovered they are not allowed to remove their borough from the European Union.

The local councillors, whose skills include patriotic fervour, will now be forced to spend the next five years making speeches about Eurocrats during planning meetings and calling for Union Jacks to be painted on wheelie bins.

Norman Steele, the new leader of UKIP-controlled Doncaster Council, said: I was proud to announce earlier today that Doncaster will be freed from the yoke of EU membership with immediate effect.

I have now been informed this will not be possible. Same goes for my plan to build a 200ft wall around the city to keep out the Bulgars.

He added: I cant even force people to wear ties.

Former BNP councillor Stephen Malley said: When I was elected in 2009 I was shocked to discover the police wouldnt obey my direct orders and that using the council to promote anti-semitism was against the law.

I couldnt get anyone deported, it turned out that Christmas wasnt actually banned and there was no money for my spectacular torchlight rally.

However, I was able to deny the Holocaust during a meeting about mobility scooters.</text>

<title>Bristol is best city because you can smoke weed in the street</title>
<text>
BRISTOL is the UKs best city to live in because cannabis is unofficially legal there, it has been claimed.

The south wests leading stoner enclave topped The Sunday Timess UK city survey for having an Amsterdam-like tolerance to pot that is weirdly never mentioned in the mainstream media.

32-year-old Stephen Malley, who recently moved to Bristol, said: I first came here to visit my cousin, and the first thing I noticed was a couple sharing a skunk bifter outside Broadmead shopping centre.

There were police around and everything, but they didnt give a toss.

Since moving down Ive discovered that every other person in the city has a grow room, even middle-aged women with mum hair. Its great.

Im not getting too much done though. Well Ive got this idea for a really good dubstep track but not the means or motivation to realise it.

Also Ive gotten into circus skills and the sort of politics that you learn from graffiti.

The Sunday Times also praised Bristol for having all its rich people live together on a big hill, in a weird kind of segregation that gives it an interesting science fiction feel.</text>

Next four episodes of 24 take place in a bus queue

JACK Bauer will mostly be trying to get a bus during next months episodes of 24.

The story takes place during a tube strike, with the fugitive agent having to travel from Hammersmith to Finsbury Park on public transport.

Producer Tom Booker said: Jacks stress levels are off the chart as he queues for hours to get to the site of a planned assassination.

Even when hes on the bus, theres nowhere to sit down and some kids with a bull mastiff are giving him evils.

After an exhausting journey to successfully save a politician from a snipers bullet, Bauer then has to get the night bus home.

Booker said: By that time its getting late and Jack cant work out from the confusing map at the bus stop whether he needs an N10 or an N30.

Of all the threats he has faced over the years, none has rivalled him riding the top deck of a night bus wearing an expensive-looking watch.</text>

<text>
Basically confirmed as the new literally

BASICALLY is this years top superfluous word, it has been confirmed.

Researchers from the Institute for Studies found that increasing self-consciousness about saying literally around grammar pedants had triggered a thousand-fold increase in the use of basically as verbal padding.

Professor Henry Brubaker said: Basically could be even bigger than literally, its a highly versatile term thats perfect for when its not enough to say a thing, but you also want to say that youre going to say it.

Doctor Stephen Malley said: Patients nowadays feel insecure unless I use basically at the beginning of sentences.

For example if I say We need to amputate your hand, they look at me blankly because that isnt basic enough.

However if I say Basically we need to amputate your hand they nod furiously.</text>

<title>Catholic church accused of saint-fixing</title>
<text>
NON-CATHOLICS have called for an investigation after they were once again passed over for sainthood.

As Pope Francis announced the canonisation of two former colleagues, evidence is coming to light of a pro-Catholic bias in the selection process.

Saintologist Nikki Hollis said: Ive personally seen David Copperfield rise from the dead after being sawn in half, but once again hes been ignored for sainthood just because hes Jewish.

And what about Derren Brown? He can make anyone do anything.

The miracles performed by Pope John Paul II and John XXIII have been criticised as insignificant compared to Browns body of work.

John Pauls sainthood application form mentions a Sicilian woman whose wart dropped off after rubbing herself with his photo, whileJohn XXIIIs miraculous powers are listed as excellent taste in wine and being really good at finding a parking space.

Robert Mugabe was present at the sainthood awardsceremony, where he pressed Pope Francis on whether making 100,000 of his own citizens disappear placed him in consideration for next years canonisations.

Hollis said: The real test will be whether they make Mother Teresa a saint after it is revealedthat for the last twenty years of her life she was a practising Jedi.</text>

<title>Liverpool regret leaving Crystal Palace game early to beat traffic</title>
<text>
BRENDANRodgers has admitted that allowing his teamto leave Selhurst Park after 79 minutes to avoidtraffic was a mistake.

Liverpool manager Rodgers made the decision when his men appeared to be on top with a 3-0 lead, but things swiftly turned around after they left.

Rodgers said: In hindsight it wasan error to withdraw my side in a bid to get a smooth run up the M1.

But it can be a nightmare getting out of south London, especially when theres football on.

Palace visibly grew in confidence and enjoyed the majority of possession in the last 11 minutes, regularly finding space on the otherwise empty pitch.

Rogers admitted: When we put the radio on and heard Palace had pulled it back to 3-2, I sensed we might be in trouble.

Its amazing how powerless you feel as a manager sometimes, especially when youre at Newport Pagnell Services queuing to buy a Twix.</text>

Harry and Cressida split after she stumbles across The Room

PRINCE Harry has split from girlfriend Cressida Bonas after she accidentally entered the special room at Kensington Palace.

Friends say the split is amicable, but it is understood the young socialite is currently at a secret location in Hampshire and will take at least three years to return to normal.

A source said: They were having a lovely time together. The would snuggle and laugh but then Harrys expression would change very suddenly and he would say do not enter the room.

Cressie had no intention of doing so, but she woke up in the middle of the night and went for a wander until she came to a door, behind which she could hear cruel laughter and a terrified voice pleading no, no, no.

She opened the door to see all of them  including that Autumn Phillips  pointing crossbows at a naked little Welshman standing on a bucket.

She screamed, they turned and stared at her and then two Grenadier Guards appeared from nowhere and injected her in the forehead with a potent sedative.

The source added: Its a shame because they would have made such a perfect couple if shed been willing to take part in the rituals.

Or at least not scream like that until everyone had finished.</text>

<title>Katie is a competent horsewoman with huge breasts</title>
<text>
It may be coincidence; it may be fate, but I notice that Katie Price has become single again at the same time as me. As far as I can see she is a competent horsewoman, an expert business person and has massive jugs to boot. Who cares if she is awfully vulgar? Should I give her a call anyway?

Just be careful. Whilst people often say that opposites attract, sometimes we need to be mindful of extreme differences. Thats the lesson my granny learned when she got a kittento keep her dog Bilko company. Granny was hoping it would turn out like The Incredible Journey; unfortunately it ended up being more like Deliverance. Poor Tootles just wanted a quiet life, but that was never going to be possible with an overly affectionateYorkshire Terrier in the vicinity. Thankfully, Tootles is completely healed now and living with a nice goldfish who respects his personal space.</text>

<title>Forced viewings of Frozen begin</title>
<text>
Letters sent out yesterday give everyone a time and cinema at which to enjoythe hit animatedmusical. Those refusing to attend face up to twelve years in jail.

Home Secretary Theresa May said: It is an absolute outrage that some members of our society think they dont have to learn the words to Let It Go just because they are childless adults.

It is every citizens duty to watch this film, have a conversation with a child about it and decide which sister they most identify with, within the next 72 hours.

The screenings, which will go on through the night, will be immediately followed by a second set of screenings so that everyone has seen the film twice.

Viewing Frozen a third timeis not mandatory, but those failing to do so will have their passports confiscated.

It is the largest initiative of its kind since the compulsory Titanic screenings of 1997, which people were forced to watch until theyunderstood that love is timeless and transcends social boundaries.

Eleanor Shaw of Luton said: The snowmans not funny, the songs are screechy, and theres no talking candlesticks or farting warthogs.

<title>BBC Swearing to be launched</title>
<text>
THEBBC is to launch an experimental swearing channel to test whether anyone really give a toss if the word fuck is heard on daytime TV.

The move follows Tory MP Nick Herberts use of fuckwit on The Daily Politics for which the BBC felt obliged to apologise even though it was not watched by anyone who gives a fuck.

The new channel will feature programmesincluding Shit Off In The Toss Attic and Bollocks Under The Fucking Hammer Wank.

BBC Director of Programming Nathan Muir said: When the Herbert thing broke, we did our usual thing of drafting an apology, when it occurred to us  its just a fucking word. Who gives a shit?

Is our entire fucking policy on swearing based on the offended sensibilities of half a dozen elderly cockheads with fuck all better to do?

Shit, piss, fuck; its what all of us do, all of the time. Whats the fucking problem? Do these people fart rainbows and copulate by post?

The channel will also feature an alternative version of the One Show, broadcast immediately after the BBC1 version, with the same presenters and guests, but with a tremendous amount of swearing.

Eye-wateringly obscene subtitles and foul-mouthed audio description will also be available.

Muir added: If it doesnt work, fuck it. But if no bastard complains then maybe at last we can call ourselves a civilised fucking country.</text>

<title>Wheres our tax cut? ask paintballing sherry enthusiasts</title>
<text>
PEOPLE who drink sherry after a vigorous afternoon of paintball have demanded a tax cut.

They claim the Chancellor has ignored them in favour of sedentary leisure pursuits and alcoholic liquids served through a pump.

Martin Bishop, from Peterborough, said: Im a hardworking person and paintballing and sherry are the only two things I enjoy. Obviously Im not that hardworking otherwise it would just be bingo, bingo, bingo.

Nevertheless, when I remove my paint-spattered body armour and grab my bottle of Croft Original I am being as British and decent as anyone.

Why is it always the stereotypes who get everything their own way?

There was also anger from people who race ride-on lawnmowers while drinking mead.

Nathan Muir, from Hatfield, said: There is nothing quite like the thrill of taking a sharp bend atop a Toro DH220 while trying not to spill your mead. It should be affordable to all the hardworking types.

Economist Julian Cook said: Paintballing and lawnmower racing do not have the same mass brainwashing potential as The Bingo.

Also, I suspect the government is trying to create a Nazi-like force of beer swilling, brown-shirted grandmothers.</text>

<title>Wolfenstein encourages kids to shoot Nazis</title>
<text>
PARENTS are worried that a new computer game where players battle Nazis could encourageanti-Nazi attitudes.

Wolfenstein: The New Order features graphic scenes of Nazi murder, Nazi dog murder and giant Nazi robot murder which could influence the thinking of impressionable teenagers.

Teenager Nathan Muir said: When I started the game I could go either way about the Nazis  they did have cool uniforms  but by the end, Id killed hundreds and was hungry for more.

I watched Saving Private Ryan and, God help me, I was dementedly cheering the Allied forces like a football fan. Im so afraid of what Ive become.

Video games expert Susan Traherne said: It is a proven fact that games like this desensitise children to the shooting of Nazis and even create neural links between Nazi death and pleasure.

How can these children function in the Britain of today, with violent urges rising every time a fellow bus passenger innocently says that foreigners should be rounded up and put into camps?

Gamer Wayne Hayes said: As an adult, Im perfectly able to tell the difference between a computer game and reality.

If I met someone with Nazi views in real life, I wouldnt shoot them. Like anyone else, Id stare at the floor until they left, then mutter vague disagreement.</text>

Tiredness the main cause of racism, say experts

PHYSICAL exertion and lack of sleep are to blame for Britains racism epidemic, according to a new study.

Medical researchers tested 200 people and found that those who had less than six hours sleep, or had been carrying heavy bags, were 80 per cent more likely to despise someone because of their ethnicity.

Dr Julian Cook said: For example, Nigel Farage would not believe all Romanians are thieves if he just spent an extra 90 minutes a day sitting or lying down.

Dr Cook also revealed that racism peaks during late spring and summer as antihistamines cause some hay fever sufferers to become drowsy and filled with ethnic hatred.

He added: I would not be remotely surprised if Nigel Farage was allergic to pollen.

The researchers found that physical tiredness releases a brain chemical which creates a rush of hormones, resulting in horrible interviews, bizarre social media postings and angry leaflets being handed out in shopping centres.

Last year, documents revealed the Ku Klux Klan was founded as a birdwatching society but became racist after the members stayed up all night taking about geese.</text>

Audi TTs driven exclusively by people who can't really afford them

EVERYONE who owns an Audi TT is living slightly beyond their means, it has emerged.

A survey of TT drivers found that none of them could sensibly afford the German coupe, but their aspirational attitudes forced them to get one on some crippling finance deal.

Additionally, 98 per cent of TT drivers work in recruitment and all of them have made-up double-barelled names.

Audi TT owner Mary Fisher-Jones said: I like to project an image of myself as an affluent go-getter, even if that means buying a car that will almost certainly get repossessed.

This year Im going on holiday to Dubai. I cant really afford that either.</text>

<title>Worlds best restaurants full of worlds worst people</title>
<text>
THE worlds most esteemed eating places are almost entirely populated by dicks.

Researchers at the Institute for Studies found that in the worlds top 50 restaurants over 85per cent of the clientele were overconfident, inexplicably wealthy red men wearing open-necked shirts tucked into stone washedjeans.

Professor Henry Brubaker said: Mostly they are company directors with Timberland deck shoes, loud pompous laughs and an unhealthy interest in what the waitress does at weekends.

They tend to have gouty complexions and uncannily thick hair like a slicked-back animal pelt.

Self-styled gourmet Martin Bishop said: I like yachts, drive one of those Porsche jeep things and refer to women as crumpet.

I eat exclusively in Michelin starred restaurants purely because they are expensive, although for me its more about getting into an alcoholic stupor than the food. Id just as soon have a load of chips.

Once they brought out a little thing that looked like a bonsai tree decorated with delicate sushi and a scented foam that evoked memories of the sea. I smashed it with my big red fist, then demanded seconds.</text>

<title>Van Gaal promises to end 13 months of hurt</title>
<text>
LOUIS van Gaal has vowed to end the cup drought that has seen many fans desert Manchester United.

The club was once a frequent renter of open top buses, but supporters now have to ask their parents what it was like back in April 2013 when it last secured a title.

Fan Wayne Hayes said: You watch old footage from two or three years ago and wonder whether things will ever be that good again.

Ive never experienced what its like to win something since I started supporting them in December.

I know things were very different in his day but if Alex Ferguson could see what weve become now hed turn in his grave.

Van Gaal has acknowledged the size of his task to rebuild a squad that contains just 25 of the players that helped win the league back in April 2013.

He said: People think Im crazy but I think we can win the league next season, if Rafael, Jones, Evans, Smalling, Carrick, Nani, Young, Cleverley, Fletcher, Valencia and Buttner can be replaced.</text>

<title>Welsh weather explained to TripAdvisor beach judges</title>
<text>
THE TripAdvisor judges who rated a Welsh beach as one of the worlds top ten are being educated on the countrys weather.

Rhossili Bay, near Swansea, beat beaches in Cuba, Brazil, Hawaii, Greece and various other locations where it doesnt piss it down every August.

Swansea resident Francesca Johnson said: I concede that on a blazing hot July day, the Rhossili beach could be briefly likened to such exotic locations. But such a day will never, ever come.

Rhossili Bay is in Wales. It is shrouded in drizzle when not battered by vicious storms. And the golden sand, while lovely, is usually being blown into your face with enough force to strip flesh.

Travel writer Joseph Turner agreed: Context is key. Mere feet from Brazils Lopes Mendes beach, a grinning barman slices fresh limes to make you a mojito while hypnotising thong-clad bottoms sashay past.

In Wales, by contrast, a pub that still adheres to the licensing laws of the 1940s will charge you 8.90 for a J2O while feral teenagers push your car into the sea.

And nowhere can be considered a paradise if to reach it one has to travel through Port Talbot.

A TripAdvisor judge said: The dragon thing caused some confusion, we thought Wales was an Indonesian island like Komodo.

In future we shall stick to what were good at  passive aggressive reviews and counter-reviews about creepy bed and breakfasts.</text>

I am shit at this, admits Clegg

NICK Clegg has refused to resign as Lib Dem leader but has admitted he is absolutely shit at it.

The self-styled deputy prime minister said stepping down would be pointless and that he should continue even though he was probably going to get even worse.

He added: I had the first vague inkling that I was very bad at this about two years ago when I realised I hadnt made any difference to anything.

But when I agreed to debate Nigel Farage about Europe, on television, I suddenly thought, fucking hell, I really dont have a clue.

Anyway, Ive had a chat with Vince Cable and we agreed that hes shit at his job too and would be just as shit at my job as I am.</text>

<title>Nutella makers launch injectable chocolate</title>
<text>
THE creators of Nutella have unveiled a new chocolate product that is taken intravenously.

As the moreish chocolate spread celebrates its 50th birthday, Ferrero launched Chocoveino, described as the worlds most direct chocolate consumption system.

A spokesman said: When we first sold our chocolate spread, people thought it would appeal only to gluttons and perverts.

They underestimated peoples desire to get chocolate into themselves by any means possible. And now they can stick it in their veins.

Chocoveino user Nikki Hollis said: It gives me a warm, chocolatey feeling that starts in my lower arm then spreads to consume my whole body.

I like it so much I stopped going to work and sold all my furniture instead.Now I spend my days lying on a mattress, lost in a brown sticky dream-land.</text>

<title>Gay computer is old peoples worst fear</title>
<text>
A COMPUTER that talks in an effeminate male voice is the biggest fear of the over-70s.

The Institute for Studies found that old people who previously spent their ample spare time worrying about homosexuals and technology were now anxious about an amalgam of the two.

83-year-old Tom Booker said: Ive heard about these Apple Gaypads that talk in a Frankie Howerd sort of voice and say rubbish like Ooh you just turned me on and Plug it into myrearsocket, go on.

Theyll have them in schools and turn all the little kiddies queer.

Pensioner Susan Traherne said: If gays moved in next door theyd probably have raucous parties with men rubbing oil on each other, but at least I could nail the bedroom windows shut.

However the laptop my son got me could use gay internet sites to invite them all into my home, unlocking the doors with its computer powers so they can come in and bugger it.</text>

<text>
WHICH of Europes powerful freaksis the real heir to the Great Dictator?

Boggle-eyed xenophobesare seizing power across the continent. But which one could fill Adolf Hitlers jackboots?

Marine Le Pen  French National Front leader whose name means The Pen by the Sea, which she hopes to fill with Jews and Muslims.Le Penis looking for a way to conquer Europe with an army that demands four-hour lunch breaks.

Odds of being new Hitler 5/1

Morten Messerschmidt  the great-grandson of a Luftwaffe Messerschmitt 109 plane which was forced down in Copenhagen during WWII and fell in love with a farm girl, this propeller-drivenDanish leader believes in closing borders, cutting benefits and an 80 per cent increase in Lego Nazi play sets.

Nigel Farage  UKIP leader considered charismatic in Britain but viewed by Europeans roughly as we view Ed Miliband. Credibility with military low after his 2010 election day attempt at piloting a light aircraft in a bombing run on Buckingham ended in disaster.

Adolf Hitler  Former German Chancellor now in present day after a failed assassination attempt by the inventor of a time machine. Currently building support in German beer halls, the all-new Hitler has swept away doubters with his fashionablequiff and handlebar moustache.</text>

<title>Public schools still top for producing bastards</title>
<text>
INDEPENDENT schools are still better than state schools at cultivating high-quality bastards, it has emerged.

Following claims that state education creates amoral pupils, the Institute for Studies found that fee-paying schools were twice as good at creating polite, well-mannered sociopaths.

Professor Henry Brubaker said: The average comprehensive school is 18 per cent bastard compared to 36 per cent in schools with lakes and gargoyles.

Private schools try to instil a moral code in pupils, usually based on a Latin slogan, but this is counterbalanced by the evilness of wealthy parents and the sense of entitlement that comes from wearing an extravagant blazer.

Professor Brubaker stressed that many of Britains biggest and worst companies were predominantly run by the privately-educated.

A lot of banks and energy companies are controlled by men who once stood on a podium and vowed to uphold the values of some Hogwarts-style edifice.

He added: It seems school is a waste of time. You may as well let kids run around until they eat each other or get bored and start reading books.

Comprehensive school student Martin Bishop said: I dont need my school to teach me whether its right or wrong to do a murder.

Ive already learned from Grand Theft Auto that its fine.</text>

Official World Cup anthem makes no reference to football or World Cup

WORLDCup anthem singers Pitbull and Jennifer Lopez do not knowwhat football is, it has been claimed.

We Are One (Ola Ole) makes no apparent reference to football or its quadrennial showpiece event, opting instead to focus mainly on flags.

A record label sourcesaid: Pitbull failedto graspeven the most basic diagrams showing the principles of football. But he gets flags,and scantily clad women.

While filming the video, Pitbull and Jennifer freaked out when a game of football was staged around them. Both curled into a fetal position to protect their clothing.

Pitbull kept enquiring in a plaintive tone where his bitches were at.

The songfeatures on theWorld Cup album One Love: One Rhythm which includes four songs about the offside rule and a world music adaptation of Fog On The Tyne.</text>

<title>Mango shortage puts middle-class kids in danger of real sweets</title>
<text>
CHILDREN of twee parents risk tasting refined sugar for the first time as Britain is hit bya mango shortage.

An EU ban on Indian mango exports means that children called Zachary and Imogen may eat their first Haribo within the month, ruining years of careful nurturing.

Mother-of-two Francesca Johnson said: Raising a middle-class child to middle-class adulthood is like walking a horse in blinkers.

You have to lead them past the terrible temptations of plastic toys, non-Iranian animation, television with adverts in, and worst of all white sugar.

Mangoes had been the perfect screen. Theyve had years of mango in the lunchbox, mango after dinner, mango as a holiday treat and never suspected.

But once they taste Tangfastics its all over.

Seven-year-old Portia Johnson said: I always wanted to be an aerospace engineer but that was before my lips felt the sublime kiss of a Vimto bon-bon.

Now I dont want to do anything but suck sherbet through a coloured straw all day every day for the rest of my life.

Her brother Bear Johnson, aged ten, said: They lied to us. Not everything is organic.

There are crisps in the world that taste of pickled onion and sweet chilli and barbecue beef, not just parsnip and beetroot and sweet potato.

Im going to burn down the house.</text>

Rejuvenating blood must be from virgins

BLOOD transfusions can reverse the ageing process but only if the donors are sexually pure, according to scientists.

Professor Henry Brubaker of the Institute for Studies said: It appears that after a person has had sex their blood is somehow soiled or tainted.

Interestingly the best blood comes from buxom female virgins, the type that combines innocence with a thinly-veiled sensuality.

Its best if they come from a medieval-style peasant village where superstition is rife, partly because they are more healthy but also theyre less likely to be missed.

71-year-old Tom Logan said: As a part of the baby boomer generation Ive already had all the houses and money, Im sure young people wont mind giving me their blood too.</text>

Perhaps your concern could extend to not eating us, say chickens

CHICKENS have thanked consumers for their concern over methods of slaughter and asked if that goodwill could be extended to just leaving them alone.

As Pizza Express confirmed all their chicken meat is halal, Britains favourite birds stressed that being stunned before having their throats cuts in the traditional Muslim fashion was small consolation, and that, ideally, they would prefer to live in an orchard.

Jane Thomson, a four month-old chicken from Lincolnshire, said: If I was a Pizza Express customer Id probably want to know if they were using religious methods of slaughter, but its a moot point because Im not a huge fan of pizza and Im a prisoner in this massive shed.

Still, its nice to know that before you shove me and all of my friends into your fat faces, youre terribly worried about how we spend our last moments. Youre an amazing species and our admiration for you is boundless.

Ms Thomson added: Funnily enough, the humans who spend their meagre salaries at the popular chicken outlets are the ones with whom we feel the greatest affinity.

Perhaps one day well all live together in a big orchard and you can give us corn and well give you eggs and no-one needs to die.</text>

<title>I only eat Wagon Wheels, says Miliband</title>
<text>
ED Miliband has confirmed his shopping bill is only 80 a week because he just eats Wagon Wheels.

The Labour leader stressed that his wife and children have a normal, balanced diet, but he has eaten nothing but the large chocolate-covered marshmallow biscuits since 1987.

He added: This keeps the weekly shopping bill down as I can get by quite happily on about 14 worth of Wagon Wheels. Its a pound for a pack of six and I go through two packs a day.

I have three with some milk in the morning, because breakfast is important. Then I put the other nine Wagon Wheels in a plastic shopping bag which I carry around all day so I can just help myself whenever I want. Its good.

Miliband said: Its a lovely biscuit and they are very big  much bigger than Penguins  which means I dont waste valuable leadership time opening lots of wrappers. But mostly I just love the name. Wagon Wheels.

My brother stole my cowboy hat when I was nine.</text>

<title>Chris Packham flees Malta on back of giant eagle</title>
<text>
TELEVISION naturalist Chris Packham has escaped Maltese police custody with the help ofbirds.

Avian species, who see Packham as a staunch ally, came to the rescue after the presenter was detained in Malta while filming illegal bird hunting.

Eyewitnesses reported birds of all kinds flocking down the chimney of the Maltese police station, pecking and clawing officers.

A pair of chaffinches removed keys to Packhams interrogation room from a guards belt, then held them in their beaks to unlock the door like in a Disney film.

Packham, who speaks 518 bird languages, was escorted onto the back of a waiting golden eagle while seagulls dive-bombed irate officers, shitting on their heads.

Collared dove Tom Logan said: Packham is our bird brother. In our tonguewe call him Kemetra which means feathers on the inside.

He added: Also he knows Michaela Strachan personally. She was so fit back in the day.</text>

<title>Government adding cocaine to tap water</title>
<text>
HUGE amounts of cocaine are being added to the water supply in a bid to make the population more productive.

As scientists discovered tap water was laced with the drug, the prime minister admitted that Operation Gak began in 2008 as a bid to increase the nations drive and enthusiasm.

David Cameron said: Think of it as like fluoride but for your brain.

The banking sector has been powered by cocaine since its inception, those guys can stay up for several days at a time doing high stakes deals with no negative health effects.

Its a naturally occurring drug that comes from a plant. Also because were the government we get the best quality beak, its not cut with worming tablets or anything.

Iain Duncan Smith sorts it out, he knows this ex-army guy Gerard who drives an Audi TT. Gerard always texts when hes parked on Downing Street with those CDs I borrowed.

Seeing as we run the policewe probably dont need to dick around like that, but Iain likes it because it makes him look hard.

Father-of-two Roy Hobbs said: This explains everything about modern British culture  why were always fighting on public transport, obsessed with showing offand wildly impatient with the elderly.

I guess its bad but I dont want them to stop. Maybe we could have coke in the cold tap and smack in the hot tap, balance things out a bit.</text>

<title>United granted Fergie Time season extension</title>
<text>
MANCHESTER United have been granted six extragames after a meeting between the Referees Association and Sir Alex Ferguson.

Two games each will be played against Norwich, Fulham and Cardiff City, giving United the chance to earn a further 18 points and putting them back in contention for the title.

Ferguson said: I explained, from a distance of one inch at a volume of approximately 110 decibels, that there had been a great deal of timewasting earlier in the season.About 640 minutes worth, in fact.

When told the extra matches cast serious doubt on whether United players could compete in this summers World Cup, Fergie said So its win-win.

Lawyers have confirmed that the basic principle of the move  if United havent won, its not over  has been an unwritten rule of the Premier League since its inception and is not open to legal challenge.

Fulham manager Felix Magath said: In agreeing to this, our club may seem like a desperate, dumped boyfriend willing to be completely humiliated just to play against a Premier League team one last time.</text>

<title>Pupils to study Goves self-published novels</title>
<text>
ALL schools will teach Michael Goves self-published novels about talking dragons and happy housewives.

Gove said dropping modern classics like To Kill a Mockingbird meant there was now room on the curriculum for the 200 or so books he has published on Kindle, of which 11 copies have been sold for 49p.

Teenage boys will love my Horatio Hove novels, about a dashing cavalry officer in the Crimean war who has a sizzling affair with Lilly Langtry even though he looks like a glove puppet frog.

I researched it by watching Sharpes Rifles and Master and Commander, so its 100 per cent historically accurate. The best bit is where Horatio sinks all Napoleons aircraft carriers.

Schools will also be required to purchase multiple copies of my fantasy epic Lord of the Thrones.

Kids will love it because its full of wonderful, imaginative ideas like magic swords, quests and talking dragons, and the reader gets a nice break from the serious bits thanks to a dwarf who gets into funny situations.

Ive even done a book for girls, Hattie the Happy Housewife.

Teacher Tom Logan said: I read one of Goves thrillers, Day of the Cultural Marxists, but I found the story about a group of terrorist teachers trying to assassinate David Cameron a bit farfetched.

Most teachers get confused by a Banda machine, so I doubt theyd be able to steal RAF Tornadoes and attack the House of Commons.</text>

<title>Government denies Buy A Massive House Free Money Woo Yeah! scheme is a stupid idea</title>
<text>
FIRST-TIMEbuyers can now borrow unlimited money to buy a mansion or castle, George Osborne has confirmed.

Buy A Massive House Free Money Woo Yeah! is being advertised with posters showing money falling out of the sky and the slogan A big house is a happy house.

George Osborne said: Hard-working young peoplefeel frustrated when they see a picture of a nice roomy castle with its own swimming pool, banqueting hall and private zoo with monkeys, but they cant have it due to lack of money.

Then they feel sad inside, and that makes me feel sad too. Luckily I am in a position to dish out money so everyone can get on the castle ladder.

The reason this will work is because once everyone has a really fucking big home they will feel inspired by their new surroundings, which will give them more energy to do lucrative overtime at work.

The chancellor confirmed that in areas with large numbers of eager first-timebuyers, helicopters will simply shower the landscape with 50 notes that can be repaid at some unspecified point in the future.</text>

<title>Surfers prepare for summer of living in wrong country</title>
<text>
BRITAINS surfers are ready for the summer season during which they might surf as many as five times.

The surfers, who can be identified by their surf clothes, surfboard roof racks and the surf stickers on their cars, are excited about the 12 to 24 breakers they will spend upward of 120 hours catching this year.

Wayne Hayes of Derby said: Your boy here was born to ride the waves.

Every fourth weekend I spend ten hours driving to Cornwall, then another two hours queuing to get to the beach, then four hours in the water waiting for a good spot before I get my surf on.

Hayes, who describes himself as an archetypal surfer dude, has a model VW camper van on his desk at work, regularly watches Point Break and owns six wetsuits.

He is one of thousands of British surfers who spend less than 0.9 per cent of each year taking part in the activity around which their identities are constructed.

Professional surfer Stephen Malley said: Surfing was invented in Hawaii, a place of year-round sunshine and big waves, and popularised in California where again, sunshine and waves.

Here in Britain there are about seven beaches that get big waves, mainly in October and November when the waters so cold it makes your balls permanently retract.</text>
