<title>Revealing Spring Attire Reminds Man He Nothing More Than Weak, Hormonal Ogre</title>
<text>
CHICAGOEradicating any sense of respectability and gentlemanliness he thought he possessed during the long winter months, local man Brendan Watt was reminded Thursday by the return of more revealing spring attire that he is nothing more than a vulgar, hormonal ogre who has to actively keep his thoughts and gaze in check whenever he goes out in public, the disheartened 33-year-old confirmed to reporters. God, Watt reportedly said to himself while walking to work amid a variety of women wearing skirts and light strapless garments, as he arrived at the annual realization that he is, despite his best hopes, a chemically driven beast who must mentally tell himself he doesnt need to take another glance at women who pass by in tank tops and yoga pants. And theres still five more months of this, for Christs sake. At press time, Watt had just caught himself taking a second look at a girl whoJesuswas a good 15 years younger than him, and was sadly accepting that this is just who he is.</text>

<title>Male Gaze Falls On Buffalo Chicken Bites</title>
<text>
BINGHAMTON, NYPatrons at Thirstys Tavern and Grill confirmed Monday that the objectifying male gaze has fallen upon a $6.95 plate of buffalo chicken bites, resulting in the menu item being treated as if it serves no purpose beyond providing pleasure to the man who ordered it. By valuing the dish only for its ability to satisfy male appetites, the gaze has reportedly stripped the food of its individuality and reinforced outmoded, centuries-old attitudes toward deep-fried chicken. According to sources, the man could be seen almost drooling as he projected his desires onto the platter before him, looking upon the happy-hour favorite as nothing more than a passive thing to be dunked in ranch dressing and eagerly consumed. Critics of the mans perspective have argued that each buffalo chicken bite deserves to be considered on its own merits and valued accordingly as the piece of meat that it is.</text>

<title>Congress Reluctant To Cut Funding For Tank That Just Spins Around And Self-Destructs</title>
<text>
WASHINGTONEscalating recent budgetary disputes with the White House over military spending, members of Congress signaled their hesitance Thursday to curtail funding for the M114 Armored Combat Vehicle, a midsize tank whose sole capability is spinning 360 degrees in place and then exploding.

The 70-ton tactical battle tank commonly known as the Dervish, which reportedly has a price tag of $95 million per vehicle and is said to begin emitting volatile, combustible fumes and sending off a dangerous fountain of sparks immediately after it is started, has been called a vital asset to national security by top congressmen on both sides of the aisle. While detractors have attempted to defund the project over the years due to its ballooning cost and the loss of every vehicle so far deployed, advocates have been able to preserve the program from cuts, hailing the tanks rightward-only movement and propensity to ignite in a towering fireball as the centerpiece of Americas war effort.

At a time when protecting United States interests at home and abroad has never been more important, we simply cannot afford to compromise our militarys ability to drive a tank repeatedly in a circle as gigantic flames shoot out of every opening on its surface, said House Armed Services Committee Chair Rep. Howard Buck McKeon (R-CA), an outspoken proponent for continued funding of the program, which has consumed over 81 billion taxpayer dollars since its inception. Cutting production of the Dervish merely because it is able to do nothing more than leave circular treadmarks and a smoking crater where it once stood would not only be irresponsible, it would leave the nation unequipped for the armed conflicts of tomorrow and put every citizen of this country at risk.

Frankly, its indicative of the diminished role in international leadership the White House sees for America that they are even willing to consider sacrificing such a critical piece of defense technology, McKeon continued. Do we really want the 1,800 U.S. servicemen who have so far died while using this piece of technology to have given their lives in vain? That seems to be what the president wants.

First developed in 1987 as part of a revitalized defense program, the M114 has become a key point of debate in Washingtons budgetary battles. Skirmishes over the Dervish date back to the early 1990s, when the program was plagued by mechanical flaws that prevented the tank from spinning at all and caused it to blow up while it sat motionless on the battlefield, a technical glitch that took nine years to fix.

Even after spinning capabilities were added, opponents have continued to question the necessity of a combat vehicle that cannot move in any direction except a 20-foot-wide loop, must be airlifted from place to place, and lacks any optical periscope or visual display monitor, a feature many note has left American drivers completely blind to both enemy combatants and friendly forces before their vehicle bursts into a ball of flaming shrapnel.

However, arguments against the Dervish have been consistently defeated by deep-pocketed defense lobbyists and the programs vocal advocates in Congress, in particular Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), whose district is home to the production facility that builds the M114 along with its amphibious assault vehicle cousin the AAV-A5, which is capable of both spinning wildly and violently exploding on land or in water.

Those who support the M114 program regard the tank as one of the most advanced forms of weaponry ever produced, noting that it has time and again proven itself capable of efficiently eliminating enemy soldiers who happen to stray within the vehicles unpredictable blast range. Still, representatives from the White House question the usefulness and efficiency of such technology in a rapidly modernizing world where wars increasingly take place in cyberspace and not on battlefields pockmarked with the smoldering remains of dozens of tanks that have almost instantaneously blown up after deployment.

Admittedly, some American soldiers stuck within the vehicle compartment have unfortunately been unable to escape within the 10- to 25-second window of time between when the tank is started and when its parts are violently ejected across a combat zone, Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-TX) told reporters, referring to the nearly 95 percent fatality rate for those assigned to operate the vehicle. But that only makes investment in this promising programs future all the more important.

The bottom line is that despite whatever weaknesses these machines may have, more Americans mightconceivablydie if it is taken off the battlefield, Thornberry added. And Im just not willing to have that conversation.

Regardless of the final outcome of the debate, officials confirmed the $601 billion defense budget passed Thursday would still be large enough to accommodate continued funding for the F-130 Flying Tinderbox fighter jet and the RIM-190 Boomerang surface-to-air missile, which flies in erratic loops and switchbacks after it is fired, causing artillery soldiers to duck as it passes over their heads several times before it ultimately returns to blow up the missile launcher.</text>

<title>Congress Splits Into Male And Female Senators To Discuss Newest Reproductive Bill</title>
<text>
WASHINGTONTo better educate lawmakers on complex reproductive issues while also providing a safe, nonthreatening environment where they can speak up and ask questions without feeling self-conscious, the U.S. Senates 100 members were separated into male and female groups Thursday afternoon prior to arguments on S.1696, the Womens Health Protection Act. Theres always some giggling when the Senate debates a womans right to privacy and choice in reproductive matters, which is okay, but we find that everyones more at ease when they can talk about it with members of their own sex, Senate Sergeant at Arms Andrew B. Willison said as the female senators were led single-file down the hall into the Senate Appropriations Committee Room where they will learn about the proposed legislation from longtime congressional leader Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-MD). This way both the male and female senators can open up and ask anything they want about the bills provisions without fear of embarrassment or teasing. For many elected officials, this is their first real introduction to a womans reproductive rights, so we want to make the process as comfortable for them as possible. Sources confirmed that Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-GA) was given a religious exemption from the discussion after providing a note from his constituents.</text>

<title>Resigned Labor Department To Give Every Unemployed American Self-Serve Yogurt Shop</title>
<text>
WASHINGTONAdmitting their agency has exhausted every other viable option for putting jobless Americans back to work, resigned officials from the U.S. Department of Labor announced plans Thursday to try giving every unemployed citizen a self-serve frozen yogurt shop to own and operate.

Labor Secretary Thomas Perez claimed the departments previous efforts, including unemployment benefits and occupational training programs, had failed to significantly improve the nations job market over the past six years, and stated that their new yogurt-based initiative was, at this point, the best way to help those who remain out of work. Perez, who repeatedly stressed that the plan was worth a try, said his agency will disburse yogurt dispensers, cash register scales, small tasting spoons, and vacant storefront and mall kiosk locations to millions of jobless Americans in the hope that selling frozen yogurt will finally help them earn a steady paycheck.

In the coming weeks, every jobless man and woman in the United States will receive the necessary supplies and equipment to open and independently manage their own frozen yogurtor fro-yo store, said Perez, who explained to anyone who was unfamiliar that frozen yogurt was like soft serve only healthier, but still tasted just as good, all factors that he said would work in the new shop owners favor. The U.S. Labor Department will provide the unemployed with the four basic flavors of chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, and banana, as well as a few sleeves of 8- and 12-ounce cups. Based on how popular yogurt seems to be right now, we believe these new store owners will be able to make a decent wage, thereby reducing jobless claims while also stimulating the broader U.S. economy.

Thats the idea, at least, he continued. To clarify, this yogurt thing is pretty much all weve got left in the tank, so lets just give it a shot, all right?

Perez argued that the program will provide an attractive opportunity for the nations roughly 10 million jobless individuals to get back on their feet, pointing out to assembled reporters that he sees frozen yogurt stores everywhere these days and that it seems like there are always people in them.

The cabinet member added that the business model also appears to be pretty cut-and-dried from what the Labor Department could tell, as customers portion out their own serving of the frozen dairy product, and all the manager really has to do is wipe down the machines and order more powdered yogurt mix when it runs low.

While the measure will reportedly supply the nations jobless citizens with such toppings as chopped nuts and rainbow sprinkles, Perez noted that these individuals would be required to pay out of pocket for other, more expensive add-ons such as kiwi slices, Heath bar crumbles, caramel, and any variety of gummy animals, as well as such premium flavors as strawberry cheesecake or mint. The Labor Secretary claimed, however, that this added variety could provide store owners an opportunity to distinguish themselves from the estimated 22,000 existing yogurt shops in the country as well as the impending influx of millions of new competitors in the coming weeks.

If the nations unemployed want to put up a big sign, or maybe decorate their stores with some kind of colorful tropical theme, that also might bring in some extra foot traffic, said Perez, adding that giving out punch cards in which the patron receives a free junior-size yogurt after buying eight regular yogurts would be particularly helpful in markets such as Detroit and Stockton, CA, where owners will be competing against dozens of other yogurt shops within a several-block radius. You could maybe sell smoothies, too; people like those. Youd have to get your own blender, though. We wont supply that.

And you can name your store whatever you want: Jennys Yogurt, The Yogurt Hut, um, Cincinnati Yogurt, uh... he continued. Great Yogurt, maybe. I dont know.

Though Perez conceded that the marketplace might take a while to adjust to the presence of tens of thousands of frozen yogurt sellers in every major U.S. city, he expressed optimism that things would work out all right as long as the American people make a concerted effort to buy a lot of yogurt and yogurt gift cards.

All these new yogurt places will need tables and hot fudge pumps and probably some teal or pink aprons for the employees and things like that, so I bet this could really get the manufacturing industry going, said Perez, noting that his office hadnt yet run the numbers on everything, but that the whole idea makes a lot of sense to him. That way, even if some of these stores go under, at least the owners can go work in the factories that make napkin dispensers and waffle cones and stuff. Right?

I guess well find out soon enough, he added, shrugging.</text>

<title>Experts Recommend Breaking Down Crushing Defeats Into Smaller, More Manageable Failures</title>
<text>
SANTA BARBARA, CAOffering advice to those who feel overwhelmed at the thought of becoming massive failures, a group of experts reported this week that the best way to approach a crippling defeat is to break it down into a set of smaller and more manageable setbacks. The key to failing on a monumental scale is to take life one small misstep at a time, life coach Jack V. Royce told reporters, emphasizing that people who hit absolute rock bottom seldom get there overnight. Just start with a couple of minor fuckups and then build off that. Its all about working through your long, humiliating downward spiral in workable increments: botch this, flub that, make a wreck of something elseand then, before you know it, youre well on your way to being totally screwed. Royce added that its also helpful every now and then to stop, take stock of your situation, and really beat yourself up about it.</text>

DANVILLE, KYSaying that he doesnt want any of that crap made in foreign countries, local man Doug Adelwright, 47, confirmed Tuesday that he only buys products manufactured right here in the United States by underpaid immigrant laborers. I always buy American, because I believe in supporting businesses that dont move their factories overseas and instead employ illegal migrant workers to make things here at home, said Adelwright, adding that youll never see a made in Bangladesh tag inside any of his shirts, because his clothes are made exclusively under U.S. sweatshop conditions. Why should I buy stuff made by exploited foreigners in another country when I can buy stuff made by exploited foreigners who work on American soil? Look, I dont want my purchasing dollars to go straight to some other country; I want my money going to good, honest workers here in the United States who then immediately send the money to their families back in other countries. Adelwright also told reporters that he would choose the craftsmanship of a human-trafficking victim smuggled into the United States over the craftsmanship of a worker in a foreign country any day of the week.</text>

<title>Brutally Honest New Revlon Ad Campaign Reminds Customers You Cant Change What You Are</title>
<text>
NEW YORKAsserting that makeup can do little beyond creating a fleeting illusion of youth and beauty, cosmetics giant Revlon launched a new series of ads this week aimed at reminding its customers they will never be able to change what they are.

The companys You Are What You Are campaign, which debuted with dark and haunting multi-page spreads in several major fashion magazines, cautions consumers that, at best, makeup is a sad disguise people hide behind in a futile attempt to avoid uncomfortable facts about their true nature.

With our new ad campaign, we want to emphasize that you can buy all the lotions, powders, and fragrances you want, but you cant escape who you really are: a fragile, flawed, and ultimately insignificant being who is tormented by fear and insecurity, Revlon vice president Vivian Falk said in a press release introducing the advertisements. Its fine to use our products if they make you feel a little more attractive, but just remember its only a temporary distraction from the terrifying reality of your barren, unfulfilling life.

Your existence is a dismal and feeble one, and no amount of mascara is ever going to change that, Falk added.

According to Revlon officials, the new campaign will include a mix of ruthlessly honest television spots, glossy print ads, and in-store promotions that encourage women to resign themselves to the bleak nature of their own humanity. In addition, billboards in major cities across America will reportedly feature images of a woman applying lipstick alongside the Revlon logo and a bold-faced slogan that simply reads, You are living a lie.

Company representatives further revealed that a new 60-second TV commercial would star a visibly distressed actress who scrutinizes her sallow and tear-streaked reflection in disgust before screaming and smashing the mirror with her fist, a sequence intended to highlight the unglamorous and excruciating character of all existence. An emotionless, monotone voice-over conveys the devastating psychological toll of coming to terms with ones identity, saying, Look at yourself: weak, afraid, all alone in this world. Everyone sees through you. Only death awaits. Revlon.

If youre disappointed by what you see on the outside, just imagine how horrifying you must be on the insidethats the message were trying to convey to our customers, said Revlon president Lorenzo Delpani, stressing that all of us are born into a terrible nightmare of tortured consciousness, a condition that he told reporters is unfortunately as immutable as it is meaningless. You can try to obscure it all beneath lip liner and eye shadow and bronzer, but at the end of the day, youre going to have to wash it off, and then whats left? Its just you, staring back at a grotesque, aging nothing consumed by doubt and regret who has made no meaningful contributions to the world.

Delpani added, You can conceal crows feet, but you can never conceal the appalling reality that is yourself.

Though emphasizing that the campaigns primary purpose is to disabuse women of the notion they can hide from themselves anywhere in this harsh worldlet alone behind endless applications of skin and hair care productsRevlon executives said they hope the ads also spur young women to think critically about the potential for true self-discovery.

Even if you could strip away all the duplicity and the self-deception, you might discover the person you imagined was there doesnt even exist, longtime Revlon chairman Ronald Perelman told reporters. Thats what happens when you spend your life cowering in fear under a layer of foundation you thought could mask your insecurities forever. When you peel away the lies and expose the real you underneath, youre going to be sickened by what you find.

And its too late to do anything about it, he added. Far too late.</text>

God, Watt reportedly said to himself while walking to work amid a variety of women wearing skirts and light strapless garments, as he arrived at the annual realization that he is, despite his best hopes, a chemically driven beast who must mentally tell himself he doesnt need to take another glance at women who pass by in tank tops and yoga pants. And theres still five more months of this, for Christs sake. At press time, Watt had just caught himself taking a second look at a girl whoJesuswas a good 15 years younger than him, and was sadly accepting that this is just who he is.</text>

<title>Look upon this Night Shift press shot and despair  Great Moments In Press Photos  The A.V. Club</title>
<text>
Every so often, we at The A.V. Club come across a staged press photo so beautiful and moving that it transcends the realm of mere publicity shot and becomes art. Great Moments In Press Photos celebrates those occasions.

His name? T.C. Callahan. His occupation? Rebel doctor.How can we convey that T.C. Callahan is the most rebellious doctor of all rebel doctors? asks the NBC publicity department responsible for press coverage of upcoming hospital drama The Night Shift. Their answer? Place him on a motorcycle in a hospital. Salvation will not come like a thief in the night. It will come on the back of a fucking motorcycle, driven right through the doors of the local hospital and into the waiting room. On its way, it will pick up some six-month-old issues of Peoplemagazine, because it has good bedside manner. Salvation is the man on the bike. Salvation is T.C. Callahan, rebel doctor.

But T.C. is not the only reason you should get all of your overnight health-care needs met by the staff of San Antonio Memorial. No. The staff of this hospital is so dedicated to your needs, oh viewer, that its members will awkwardly Photoshop themselves into press stills just so they might be near T.C. when he rockets to your side. They will run, wind streaming through their hair. They will crawl, looks of pure desperation on their faces. They will reach one arm outward, as if to say,Stop! but you know they are really saying,Go! because it is only your health they wish to protect.

Look upon the full version of the photo here. Notice how beautifully it uses negative space. Those ceiling tiles suggest not a poorly cropped photo but, instead, the infinite. If T.C. Callahan and the doctors of San Antonio Memorial were your primary health-care providers, you would never need fear death. You, too, would transcend time and space and be able to ride motorcycles in hospitals. We are trapped between ceiling and floor, but a man on a motorcycle shall lead us.

For the past several years, the Barack Obama administration has struggled with how to sell the American public on the virtues of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. In this press photo, NBC and the Night Shiftpublicity team have given the administration a great gift. ThisTHISis the face of Obamacare. A man on a motorcycle and those who would crawl to help him and a solemn contemplation of the infinite. Now we all need never die.

This has been Great Moments In Press Photos.</text>

<title>Taco Bell Warns Employees Against Directly Exposing Skin To Food</title>

IRVINE, CAIn a new handbook distributed Friday to employees at all 6,500 of its locations worldwide, fast food chain Taco Bell has issued an updated set of safety protocols that warns workers against directly exposing their skin to any of its food products.

The companys revised food-handling directives, which apply to every item on the restaurants Tex-Mexinspired menu, require employees to notify their shift manager immediately if Taco Bell ingredients make even brief surface contact with any part of their body, with the exception of instances when items come in contact with the eyes, in which case all workers are instructed to use the nearest emergency eye wash fountain without delay.

We want our team members to protect themselves from the dangerous complications that result when the skin of ones hands or face is directly exposed to either a regular menu item or a featured promotional specialty during the food preparation process, read an excerpt from the 436-page manual, noting that an employees first line of defense is to wear chemically impermeable butyl gloves when dispensing the restaurants meats, salsa, or three-cheese blends. The easiest way to ensure safety on the job is to wear an approved Taco Bell long-sleeve work coat and disposable latex shoe covers at all times while in the restaurants kitchen, and above all, be mindful when preparing a menu item so that no food or condiment ever touches exposed flesh.

However, in the event of epidermal contact with any of our meat fillings, you must immerse the affected area under running water at once and then apply the neutralizing chemical agent found in the wall-mounted dispensers located every five feet above the food preparation counters, the manual continues.

The new instructional materials detail numerous preventative measures employees should follow to avoid compromising their health, such as limiting their kitchen shifts to three hours in order to prevent prolonged exposure to dollar-menu items or a maximum of 25 minutes if the kitchens fume hoods are not functioning. In addition, the handbook urges workers to take their breaks outdoors in fresh air at least 100 feet away from any Doritos Locos Taco.

The guidelines further direct kitchen workers to seal any broken taco shells in specially marked plastic bags and discard the bags in one of the red puncture-resistant waste disposal containers located throughout the kitchen. Employees are also instructed to wear their company-issued safety goggles before entering the burrito assembly area, know the location of the restaurants emergency potassium iodide tablets, and submit themselves to periodic testing with a qualified toxicologist.

It is also recommended that any clothing soiled with Zesty Pepper Jack Sauce be disposed of as soon as possible in the industrial furnaces provided at each franchise location for this purpose.

Under no circumstances should employees remove their lead aprons when in the vicinity of any of our nacho-based menu options, the manual states. Furthermore, Taco Bell crew membersespecially those who are pregnant or might become pregnantmust always wear aluminized protective coveralls and a military-grade respirator mask in the presence of our refried beans.

It is absolutely imperative that the Cheesy Gordita Crunch be assembled behind a pane of protective glass until the moment it is served to customers, the manual adds. There can be NO EXCEPTIONS to this rule.

The instructional booklet goes on to state that if a worker accidentally touches any one of the seven layers in a seven-layer burrito, he or she must quickly take a disinfecting chemical shower, even if contact occurs during the lunch rush.

A foreword to the manual written by company CEO Greg Creed assures Taco Bell workers that, as long as they follow the officially delineated standard protocol for food preparation and all internationally accepted guidelines from the National Association of Corrosion Control Engineers, they need not worry about contamination on the job. Creed admitted, however, that accidents have occurred at chain locations from time to time.

Each Taco Bell location is equipped with sophisticated sensors able to identify and seal off any zone in which airborne concentrations of Border Sauce reach unsafe levels above 12 parts per million, said Creed, explaining that the system would also react to any guacamole or sour cream spills. Should the alarm be triggered, decontamination locks will isolate the clean chamber along with all those inside until an appointed Yum! Brands hazmat team arrives from corporate headquarters and is able to ascertain if the scene is salvageable.

Of course, our company strives to avoid these sorts of quarantine scenarios whenever possible, Creed added.

Pressed for comment, Taco Bell representatives noted that during the month of June, customers could upgrade any of their purchases with a delicious, thirst-quenching Mountain Dew Typhoon Freeze for only $1.99.</text>

<title>High School Suspends Hunky Student For Wearing Shirt</title>
<text>
MURFREESBORO, TNSaying it was potentially disruptive to an educational environment in which all were entitled to see his rock-hard abs, administrators at Merritt High School suspended hunky senior Ryan Magnuson Wednesday for wearing a shirt. When a teacher noticed that the shirt was obscuring the view of his shoulders, pecs, and the rest of his muscular torso, the student in question was sent to the office and ordered to remove the inappropriate garment, said assistant principal Janet Norcross, citing the schools zero-tolerance policy for students whove got the goods but refuse to flaunt them. The student handbook makes perfectly clear what we expect of our beefcakes, and we expect them to comply. Norcross added that Magnuson was initially given the option of turning his shirt inside out, as long as he did it nice and slow.</text>

<title>The long-running private eye series Mannix was brutal, stylish comfort food  100 Episodes  The A.V. Club</title>
<text>
For most of the history of television, the barrier to syndicationand to profitabilityhas been 100 episodes. The shows that have made it to that mark are an unusual group. Many were big hits. Some found small cult audiences. Still others just hung on as best they could and never posted numbers quite low enough to be canceled. In 100 Episodes, we examine the shows that made it to that number, considering both how they advanced and reflected the medium and what contributed to their popularity.

A private eyein the classical tradition, was Joe Mannixs modest self-description, delivered with a wry smile. It was a throwaway line from an early episode, repurposed ad nauseam in clever TV Land ads that touted the series twice-a-day reruns during the late 1990s. But it captured the ethos of Mannix, a no-frills detective drama that was the template for a glut of crime series that choked the airwaves during the early 70s (and Mannix was more a show of the 70s than the 60s, even though it debuted in 1967). Cannon was the fat private dick, Barnaby Jones was the old one, Longstreet was the blind (yes, blind) one. Mannix was the original model. Like the early seasons of ER or C.S.I., Mannix was put together with skill and care, but its mainstream success made it easy to take for granted.



Mannix was easy to take, period. The low-key personality of Mike Connors, the former basketball player and B-movie actor who played the title character, set the tone. Likable but flinty, Connors was a tough guy who didnt have to show off. An idealist and a nice guy, Mannix was perfectly willing to take on a lost little girl as a client and negotiate his fee in lunch money (never actually collected, of course). Connors had a rare sincerity that kept scenes like that from getting corny. (When cynical private eye shows like Harry O and The Rockford Files made a point of their protagonists pragmatic eye for a buck, it was mainly Mannix they were rebuking.) Working out of a comfy Spanish-styled home office, dressed in plaid sport coats made out of fabric as thick as carpet, driving a snazzy muscle car painted a hideous shade of army-Jeep green, Joe Mannix was functional but square. It was all of a piece. Mannix was the audiences uncle or its brother-in-lawthat quiet, comforting fellow who never let on that hed mowed down a whole squadron of advancing enemies during the war. (Joes actual backstory included service in Korea; another often-mocked TV trope, the one where the deranged vet returns to kill off all the members of his old platoon, comes more from Mannix than any other single show.) Mannixs secretary, Peggy Fair, was cannily drawn to underscore his avuncular solidity. Played by Gail Fisher, one of the more prominent African-American actors on television at the time, Peggy was the widow of Mannixs old partner on the police force, so naturally hed never make a pass. She was also a single mother, which meant that the producers could show Mannix in surrogate dad mode whenever little Toby (Mark Stewart) turned up.

Mannix was a fabulously violent program. Joe Mannix got brained on the back of the head or shot in the shoulder in just about every episode. If the primary bad guys were recognizably human characters, the anonymous bruisers who did their bidding, usually clad incongruously in suits and always in pairs, were a class of criminal that existed only on television: Goons R Us. Not content to use their fists, this ever-replenishable army of nameless hoods attacked Mannix with motorcycles, dune buggies, race cars, helicopters. And yet Mannix went down so easily that, no matter how often critics singled out its brutality, it escaped unscathed; other shows, like The Outsider (a rival P.I. series starring growly Darren McGavin, who had been considered early on to play a more roughhewn Mannix), were retooled or canceled in the wake of the 1968 assassinations, but Mannix grew ever more baroquely violent. Mannix had one of the all-time great theme songs, by Lalo Schifrin, who had made his name a season before with the iconic theme for Mission: Impossible (a sort of sibling to Mannix, also produced on the Paramount lot by a unit under producer Bruce Geller). But while Schifrins Mission: Impossible theme was brassy and urgent, his Mannix music was a toe-tapping suite of coffeehouse jazz. With Schifrins main title tune rattling around in their heads for the duration of the hour, viewers couldnt get too worried about what was going to happen to their hero. Everything about Mannix fostered a sort of harmoniously agreeable mood. It was comfort-food television, in the best sense.

But Mannix began as something much less high-concept: an intellectual take on the private-eye genre from William Link and Richard Levinson, the creators of Columbo. During its first seasonso different from what followed that it was usually excluded from syndicationJoe Mannix worked for a large, efficiency-oriented private-detective firm, whose operatives were valued less than the firms gigantic crime-solving data center. Mannix, an ex-cop, took an intuitive, old-school approach that put him at odds with the head of Intertect, Lew Wickersham (Joseph Campanella). Man versus machine: Joe Mannix was John Henry and the steam hammer was a computer. Intertect, as Link and Levinson originally titled the show, was meant as an allegory, in which the familiar cloak of the mystery genre would conceal a critique of soulless, modern corporate life.



Wickershams name was a pun on that of Hollywood mogul Lew Wasserman and also Lankershim Boulevard, where sat the main entrance to Universal Studios. In 1959, Universal had been acquired by MCA, a talent agency with a reputation for ruthlessness. Its agents, many of whom became Universal executives, wore uniform black suits and ties, and MCA president Wasserman was known for his scary bursts of temper and his always-empty desk (paper was for underlings). By the late 60s, Universal was the biggest television factory in the industry; it conducted business out of an ominous glass-walled slab nicknamed The Black Tower, and was the first studio to keep track of its employees using computer punch cards. Link and Levinson, who had written for Alfred Hitchcock Presents there, incorporated all of these details into the original format of Mannix, making Intertect a rich inside joke.

Unfortunately, Link and Levinson were out even before the cameras turned on the pilot. The pair sold the idea to Desilu (Lucille Balls production company), which placed it in the hands of Bruce Geller (the creator and executive producer of Mission: Impossible), who hired Wilton Schiller (of Ben Casey and the lackluster final season of The Fugitive) to produce. By the time Mannix passed through all those hands, no one involved knew how to write it. Mannix and Wickersham bickered with each other every week like the Kramdens, but the hot air had little to do with their cases, and changed nothing. Since both characters had to keep showing up for work, Mannix was locked into a talky stasis. Link and Levinsons clever premise would have worked better 30 years later, in a semi-serialized show like The X-Files, where one-off mysteries could alternate with a deeper mythology about the sinister and soul-crushing nature of Intertect.

Mannix was a bubble show in 1968, and rather than scrap it or try to fix the stillborn Mannix/Wickersham conflict, Geller and CBS opted to revamp the format as a traditionalsome might say genericdetective drama. A sarcastic Levinson imagined the network meeting that okayed the format change: What have you got? A private eye who solves cases. Brilliant! Campanella was let go and Schiller was replaced by Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts, veteran screenwriters (White Heat; Midnight Lace) with good taste in directors and guest stars and a knack for intricate stories. Connors and the new producers agreed to discard Joe Mannixs hard-edged, wisecracking Intertect-era persona and try for a rarer strain of romanticism. Now Mannix would love the ladies and lose them, would confront his estranged father (a central California vintner, stubborn like Joe Mannix and of Armenian heritage like Connors, played by Victor Jory in a pair of episodes), would play the white knight when Peggy or his old pals or girlfriends got into trouble. Instead of Wickersham and his computer, Mannix would spar with a steady rotation of recurring cops (including Robert Reed as Lt. Adam Tobias, a guest star whose banter with Connors was so free-wheeling and enjoyable that Mannix brought him back whenever he could get free of his regular gig as dad to The Brady Bunch). Goff and Roberts made sure to commission a couple of episodes each season in which Mannix was shot or blinded oras in The Mouse That Died, a riff on the 1950 film D.O.A.dosed with a slow-acting poison. It was shameless Emmy bait, and it worked surprisingly well. Mannix netted a slew of nominations (including four for Connors, two for best drama, and a win for Fisher, a showing that was only possible in an era when action shows had crowded out most serious dramas off the air), and an even bigger haul at the Golden Globes.



More creatively satisfying than the stunt episodes, though, were the fatalistic, character-driven mysteries that were the shows regular fare. Under Goff and Roberts tenure, Mannix was written by a corps of televisions best crime specialists, including Stephen Kandel, Ed Adamson, Frank Telford, Robert W. Lenski (a former police beat reporter who had written only a few variety specials prior to Mannix), and themselves (under the pseudonym Blake Ritchie). In their hands, Mannix was not a sleuth so much as an island of competence amid a succession of lives in tragic disarray. Mannix was too traditional a hero to lose any cases, but the catch was that solving the case didnt always solve the clients problems. In Odds Against Donald Jordan, for instance, Mannix tries to rescue Jordan (James Olson) from some hoods seeking, at gunpoint, to collect an unpaid gambling debt. It turns out that the mobsters dont care enough to kill, and the whole thing is Jordans ruse to steal another gambling stake from his friends and family. In the end all Mannix can do is stage an intervention. Mannix was too smooth, too 70s to qualify as neo-noir, but more than anything else on television it did echo the flavor of its eras most unsentimental crime novelists, authors like Ross Macdonald, John D. MacDonald, Richard Stark.

But the most exciting element of Mannix is its imagery, which was flamboyant in the tamer episodes and unhinged in the rest. Take zooms, rack focuses, lens flares, extreme wide and long lenses, extreme low, overhead, and Dutch angles, handheld and gyroscope-mounted cameras, and deep multiplanar compositions, then add a lysergic dose of pop-art production design and 52-card pick-up editing, and you have the house style of Mannix. Like many of the more visually inventive shows of the late 60s and early 70s, Mannix reflected two very different, but in some ways convergent, sources: the European New Wave cinema and television commercials, which had incubated many catchy, cutting-edge visual gimmicks to snare viewers attention in their allotted seconds.

Stuart Hagmann, who directed four of the best Mannix episodes in 1968 and 1969, came out of commercials; still in his 20s, he had gained attention for some Eastman Kodak ads that aired during the 1967 Oscars. A long sequence in Odds Against Donald Jordan has Mannix offering a sympathetic shoulder to Jordans wife (Susan Oliver) at the same time hes gently interrogating her. Hagmann opens with a shot of the pair in Mannixs convertible, taken through the windshield, as the dense foliage overhead is reflected in the glass. The shadows of the leaves are so thick that Oliver and Connors are barely visible underneath them. An abrupt cut finds the two on the beach and (via an even bolder jump cut) on a pier, eating hot dogs. Hagmann cuts away to seagulls in flight or congregating on the sand, and to the orange ball of the sun on the horizon; eventually the birds and the sunset are superimposed over one another. Much of the dialogue is heard over these abstract images. In the last part of the scene, Hagmann starts with an extreme long shot of Oliver and Connors on the pier and pulls back even further, leaving them barely visible in silhouette as Mannix cuts to commercial. Imaginative as the visuals are, they dont overpower the wistful performances by Oliver and Connors, who hint at an unconsummated attraction. The same scene could have been staged just as easily in a living-room set; and had this been an episode of Ironside (whose star, Raymond Burr, didnt like to leave the studio) it probably would have been.



Paul Krasny, who had been the supervising film editor for Mission: Impossible and Mannix while still in his early 30s, debuted as a director on the latter series. Predictably adept at rapid, complex editing, and expert at staging action and chase sequences, Krasny directed more Mannixes than anyone else (over two dozen) and set the style for the later seasons. One of the best Krasny showcases is Death Is The Fifth Gear, in which slow motion, solarization, optical effects, and a series of dense montages are used convey Mannixs disoriented state after he flames out in an auto race. Sutton Roley, another prolific Mannix director, favored wide-angle lenses and had a fetish for framing actors within some looming foreground object. The quintessential Roley shot was a long take in which the camera makes two or three forceful moves, each time emphasizing a shift in the scene by reframing the actors in some striking arrangement within the set. In the terrific The Solid Gold Web, Roley stages a romantic scenea rekindling of the feelings between Mannix and a troubled old flame (Sally Kellerman) during a slow dancein a two-minute take photographed through a bird cage, in which parakeets flit back and forth in the foreground, out of focus, repeatedly obscuring and then revealing the lovers.

The caged-bird metaphor is potent, but does the dialogue actually register? Roley has a cult reputation among TV aficionados as a gonzo stylist, whose compositions were always dazzling but could at times overpower the content of a scene. On Mannix, though, Roley fit in perfectly. He was part of a consistent roster of aggressively camera-oriented directors that also included Leonard J. Horn (first among equals as the director of Mannixs pilot, and of the first feature film Geller produced, Corky), Barry Crane (formerly the line producer for Mission: Impossible, a series known as the director killer because its rapid pacing required an unusually high number of camera set-ups), and Reza Badiyi (designer of the opening titles for Hawaii Five-O and Mary Tyler Moore). Geller, who had also given Mission: Impossible a bold look, understood that action shows needed a kinetic texture. Joe Mannix lived in a violent world, and Mannix was built out of violent filmmaking.



Mannix ran for eight seasons and was still in the Nielsen Top 20 when it was canceled, apparently in an obscure falling-out between Paramount (which had bought Desilu, and its shows, in 1967) and CBS over late-night syndication of the series, which the network feared would cut into new episodes ratings. Goff and Roberts went on to create Charlies Angels, proving that no talent, no matter how skilled, could produce quality work in the employ of Aaron Spelling. Plans for a TV-movie revival of Mannix, almost inevitable for a hit show of the 70s, collapsed with Bruce Gellers death in a plane crash in 1978, although Connors did reprise the character in a nostalgic 1997 Diagnosis: Murder that reassembled three surviving guest stars for a sequel to the episode Little Girl Lost. Its a sign of how unassuming the character was that there hasnt been a new Mannix, even as schlocky relics like Ironside and The Bionic Woman have been revived in the current millennium. If it has to happen, they might as well remake it nowwhile Connors is still available to play the new Joe Mannixs dad.

<title>Something Apparently Going On With Mom And Her Best Friend</title>
<text>
SEWICKLEY, PANoting the abrupt cessation of nightly phone calls and general references to her longtime confidante, household sources confirmed Wednesday that something is evidently going on between local mom Catherine Bowen, 51, and her best friend Ellen Kearns, 50.

According to family members, Mom and Ellen have always been super close and do stuff together every week. Daughter Emily Bowen, 15, told reporters that the two women, who have known each other since college or possibly even high school, probably got into it at some point or another and must not be getting along.

It definitely seems like something is up with Mom and Ellen, said the teenager, who confirmed that she did not know what the deal was between the two friends. They usually get coffee and go for a walk a couple times a week, but they havent lately.

And Mom has been a little more uptight recently, added Emily. I have no idea whats going on.

Though sources could not identify the origin or precise nature of a potential falling out, family members suggested it was very likely that something or other happened, because the two friends had not gone shopping for a couple of weeks at the Basket Loft or that one stationery store they both like so much. In addition, reports indicate Mom recently skipped the monthly Bunco Night at Ellens house.

Sources also told reporters it was likely that one or possibly both of the womens feelings might have been hurt.

Sometimes they can get on each others nerves, said Lauren Bowen, 18, adding that Ellen gripes about tons of stuff and Mom tends to be somewhat bossy toward her friend. I dont know what this ones about, but if they miss Art In The Park this Sunday, Id say its pretty severe.

I heard Dad mention Ellen, and Mom just kind of whispered something back and he dropped it, Lauren continued.

According to those close to the situation, this is not the first time that something has been going on with Mom and Ellen. Family members confirmed that a heated phone conversation overheard while Mom was pacing on the front porch in 2008 resulted in the middle-aged best friends ceasing contact for several weeks. Sources verified that the spat was probably over a timeshare in Tampa or who would bring some kind of casserole to a church thing.

Bowen family members said that Mom calls and vents to her other good friend Georgia Bedo, 51, whenever she and Ellen hit a rough patch.

Shes been talking to Georgia more now, said 52-year-old husband Paul Bowen. That means something is not going well with Ellen. This happens from time to time.

I think this could be a bad one, he continued, explaining that during a typical tiff, his wife will rekindle her relationship with Georgia for anywhere from two days to multiple weeks, depending on the severity of her flap with Ellen. She was making plans with Georgia to go to the outlets. Thats certainly not a good sign.

Family sources confirmed that things between the middle-aged pair were real bad as of press time, as Bowen had finished reorganizing her closet and was seen leaving for a walk to the frozen yogurt shop, alone.</text>

<title>Disney CEO Figures Theyve Built Up Enough Goodwill To Do A Real Sexist One</title>
<text>
BURBANK, CACiting a groundswell of praise for such stereotype-bucking princess films as Frozen, Brave, and Tangled, Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger said Thursday his company has probably accumulated enough goodwill to make its next animated feature a real sexist one.

Though still unsure whether the forthcoming fairy-tale adventure would center on a helpless Dutch peasant who splits her time between domestic duties and pining for a rich man, a vain young princess who constantly preens in front of any reflective surface, or a curvaceous, long-lashed horse who inexplicably has rouged cheeks and eye shadow, top Disney officials agreed they are well positioned to sneak in an overly chauvinistic film that exploits antiquated female stereotypes for all theyre worth.

Weve had a pretty solid run of strong, independent heroines, so I think weve racked up enough cred to get back to what we do best and make a regular old damsel-in-distress picture with some real heavy themes about purity, said Iger, surmising that after the studios recent streak of well-rounded female protagonists, audiences would surely let a real dumb one slide. At this point, I think well be fine if we slip in a movie with some blond girl who always combs her hair, sings sad songs about the man shes longing for, and otherwise doesnt say much. Or maybe shes a foolish, overly emotional robin who is constantly patted on the head and kept in line by her knowing father.

Either way, shell only be able to titter coyly, weep, or fret, Iger continued. And shell definitely completely alter who she is to win the heart of her love interest. Id say we can probably get away with that.

Noting that critics have given them a tremendous amount of credit in recent years for creating female leads who are plucky, self-reliant, and get by on their wits, Iger said there will never be a better time to give the go-ahead to a screenplay that hinges on a passive young woman who does nothing but wait in place for a man to come validate her existence through marriage. The CEO also indicated that churning out a story in which all the female characters are either petty, naive, vapid, or love-crazy, and in which the lone voices of reason come from levelheaded male woodland creatures or paternalistic sorcerers, would be a walk in the park for his creative team.

According to Iger, Disney believes it now has the cultural cachet to make its most misogynist movie in years, perhaps by going back to a female lead whose life is empty, unfulfilling, and valueless until the moment she receives true loves first kiss.

While the film has yet to be storyboarded, Iger added that it is a given that the heroine will be so helpless and unable to make decisions on her own that she will require the aid of small animals to guide her at critical moments.

Were still kicking around ideas, but I can tell you that if we dip back into the princess well, the main character will be thin, pretty, and whitethat much were sure of, said Iger, stressing that Disneys executive board had given writers the green light to revert to the basics on this one. We dont have to do any of that Princess And The Frog garbage for a while. We did Pocahontas, we did Mulan, so were all set for diversity right now. Audiences can expect a real porcelain-skinned one with disproportionately large blue eyes and a waist so small it couldnt possibly contain functioning organs.

And even though shes supposed to be just 15 or something like that, well definitely give her a full hourglass figure and a few skintight outfits, he added. We definitely have enough goodwill in the tank to pull that off.

Executives confirmed that as long as Disneys audience is willing to bear with them on this one, a completely sexist blockbuster could prove to be a huge boon for the media company, spawning a lucrative franchise that could extend to several sexist sequels and even a degrading Broadway musical adaptation.

However, Iger noted that the companys merchandising department would be the primary beneficiary of the movies success. By implying to another generation of young girls that their principal value as individuals lies in being deferential, sexually desirable beings, the movie would help the company continue to cash in on its profitable line of princess-themed dolls, clothing, personal products, and video games, the CEO confided to reporters.

Look, at the end of the day, were trying to move some product here, Iger said. No one asks for Mulan wearing shapeless warriors armor for Christmas. So were putting the next one in sparkly heels, a tiara, and a form-fitting dress slit to the thigh. End of story.</text>

<title>Neil Young and Jack White give old songs new meanings  Music Review  The A.V. Club</title>
<text>
The anemic state of the music industry frequently raises suspicions about gimmicks and marketing ploys, and if not for the reputations of its creatorsNeil Young and Jack Whitethats how A Letter Homemight sound on paper.Recorded using a 1947 vinyl recording booth, A Letter Home risks putting process ahead of the listening experience, sacrificing fidelity for a cute narrative. Though Whites decade-long hunt for a Voice-O-Graph and its painstaking 18-month refurbishment are admirable, does that make up for the crackle and hum of the machines single-track recordings, or the occasional warping of Youngs iconically frail vocals? And beyond that, is there really a need to re-record songs that are either so iconic (Bruce Springsteens My Hometown, Willie Nelsons On The Road Again and Crazy) or over-represented (Gordon Lightfoots If You Could Only Read My Mind, Tim Hardins Reason To Believe) that their lyrical weight has been rendered mostly meaningless?

The answer to both is a convincing yes, though a willingness to accept the collection on White and Youngs terms is crucial to getting anything out of A Letter Home. These terms are laid out in the spoken intro track, in which Young addresses his mother at the recommendation of his friend Jack. Of course, Youngs mother has been dead since 1990, making his requests for her to start talking to daddy since they are together now (he died in 2005) all the more tender. Later, Young prefaces Reason To Believe with another message to mom, this time recalling playing many of the albums tracks while living with his family in Canada. Nothing about these little dedications seems contrived, though; rather, they give the mans 35th studio album (yeah, a recording booth counts as a studio) a sense of purpose.

The idea that faded, wrinkled songs and an antiquated recording technique can transcend Youngs personal connection, which he claims changed his life, and connect listeners to their own past or to a time thats long gone is present in every raw, clumsy word Young utters on the album. Likewise, the performances are often inspired enough that the right impressionable mind could easily hear Youngs rendition of, say, Needle Of Death, the albums grim highlight, and find their own life changed. Sure, Youngs Crazy could never match the Patsy Cline record, and his take on The Everly Brothers I Never Care As Much wastes Whites guest harmonizing on a slight, anti-climactic album closer. But as a whole, Young and White have managed to make an album thats absolutely useful with arecording process that is absolutely central to that use.</text>

<title>Taco Bell Warns Employees Against Directly Exposing Skin To Food</title>
<text>
IRVINE, CAIn a new handbook distributed Friday to employees at all 6,500 of its locations worldwide, fast food chain Taco Bell has issued an updated set of safety protocols that warns workers against directly exposing their skin to any of its food products.

The companys revised food-handling directives, which apply to every item on the restaurants Tex-Mexinspired menu, require employees to notify their shift manager immediately if Taco Bell ingredients make even brief surface contact with any part of their body, with the exception of instances when items come in contact with the eyes, in which case all workers are instructed to use the nearest emergency eye wash fountain without delay.

We want our team members to protect themselves from the dangerous complications that result when the skin of ones hands or face is directly exposed to either a regular menu item or a featured promotional specialty during the food preparation process, read an excerpt from the 436-page manual, noting that an employees first line of defense is to wear chemically impermeable butyl gloves when dispensing the restaurants meats, salsa, or three-cheese blends. The easiest way to ensure safety on the job is to wear an approved Taco Bell long-sleeve work coat and disposable latex shoe covers at all times while in the restaurants kitchen, and above all, be mindful when preparing a menu item so that no food or condiment ever touches exposed flesh.

However, in the event of epidermal contact with any of our meat fillings, you must immerse the affected area under running water at once and then apply the neutralizing chemical agent found in the wall-mounted dispensers located every five feet above the food preparation counters, the manual continues.

The new instructional materials detail numerous preventative measures employees should follow to avoid compromising their health, such as limiting their kitchen shifts to three hours in order to prevent prolonged exposure to dollar-menu items or a maximum of 25 minutes if the kitchens fume hoods are not functioning. In addition, the handbook urges workers to take their breaks outdoors in fresh air at least 100 feet away from any Doritos Locos Taco.

The guidelines further direct kitchen workers to seal any broken taco shells in specially marked plastic bags and discard the bags in one of the red puncture-resistant waste disposal containers located throughout the kitchen. Employees are also instructed to wear their company-issued safety goggles before entering the burrito assembly area, know the location of the restaurants emergency potassium iodide tablets, and submit themselves to periodic testing with a qualified toxicologist.

It is also recommended that any clothing soiled with Zesty Pepper Jack Sauce be disposed of as soon as possible in the industrial furnaces provided at each franchise location for this purpose.

Under no circumstances should employees remove their lead aprons when in the vicinity of any of our nacho-based menu options, the manual states. Furthermore, Taco Bell crew membersespecially those who are pregnant or might become pregnantmust always wear aluminized protective coveralls and a military-grade respirator mask in the presence of our refried beans.

It is absolutely imperative that the Cheesy Gordita Crunch be assembled behind a pane of protective glass until the moment it is served to customers, the manual adds. There can be NO EXCEPTIONS to this rule.

The instructional booklet goes on to state that if a worker accidentally touches any one of the seven layers in a seven-layer burrito, he or she must quickly take a disinfecting chemical shower, even if contact occurs during the lunch rush.

A foreword to the manual written by company CEO Greg Creed assures Taco Bell workers that, as long as they follow the officially delineated standard protocol for food preparation and all internationally accepted guidelines from the National Association of Corrosion Control Engineers, they need not worry about contamination on the job. Creed admitted, however, that accidents have occurred at chain locations from time to time.

Each Taco Bell location is equipped with sophisticated sensors able to identify and seal off any zone in which airborne concentrations of Border Sauce reach unsafe levels above 12 parts per million, said Creed, explaining that the system would also react to any guacamole or sour cream spills. Should the alarm be triggered, decontamination locks will isolate the clean chamber along with all those inside until an appointed Yum! Brands hazmat team arrives from corporate headquarters and is able to ascertain if the scene is salvageable.

Of course, our company strives to avoid these sorts of quarantine scenarios whenever possible, Creed added.

Pressed for comment, Taco Bell representatives noted that during the month of June, customers could upgrade any of their purchases with a delicious, thirst-quenching Mountain Dew Typhoon Freeze for only $1.99.</text>

<title>Miami Heat Confident They Have The Right Officiating To Triumph Over Pacers</title>
<text>
INDIANAPOLISAfter rallying to tie the Eastern Conference Finals at one game apiece, members of the Miami Heat expressed their confidence Wednesday that they have the right officiating to ultimately overcome the Indiana Pacers. Indianas a great team, no question, but at the end of the day I think we have the right group of refs on the court to push us to the win, Heat small forward LeBron James told reporters, adding that late in the game the team can always depend on officials to get them to the foul line. In a tight series, you need to get the big whistles when it counts, and fortunately guys like [referee Joey] Crawford always deliver for us. Theyre obviously great during the regular season too, but theyre really clutch in the playoffs. James went on to say that in the final seconds of a close contest, he trusts the refs to make the game-winning call.</text>

<title>Ron Harper Wont Stop Telling People He Was On Dream Team</title>
<text>
WAYNE, NJHaving insisted on the falsehood for the better part of two decades, sources confirmed Thursday that retired NBA player Ron Harper wont stop telling people that he was on the national mens basketball Dream Team that brought home the gold medal for the U.S. in 1992. Man, well never again have a group of superstars like we did in 92; Im just proud to have been a part of it, the journeyman shooting guard reportedly told his checkout clerk at a local Stop & Shop earlier this week, adding his oft-repeated claim that being selected as a starter for that squad was the biggest honor of [his] life. That team was something else: Magic, Jordan, Bird, Barkley, and me, manning the perimeter. We were unstoppable. Granted, what we accomplished in 96 was pretty great too, but nothing can ever come close to that summer in Barcelona. According to sources, the former athlete was later heard regaling a toll booth operator about his legendary flu game during the 1997 NBA Finals, in which a severely ill Harper improbably managed to score 38 points en route to a Chicago Bulls victory.</text>

<text>
LOS ANGELESEarly reviews confirmed Thursday that X-Men: Days Of Future Past, the latest installment in the popular superhero film series, prominently features a storyline in which director Bryan Singer journeys through a portal in the space-time continuum to an earlier era, where he coerces his 16-year-old self into sexual intercourse. Hey, I work in moviesyou have any interest in Hollywood? the director reportedly says in the film, caressing his teenage selfs shoulder in a scene preceded by a montage that includes Singer frantically searching for a coke dealer on the Lower East Side and attempting to contact older studio executives for a wild party later that night. Theres going to be a little get-together in my hotel room at the Ritz later on. Tons of kids like you will be there, and a few showbiz bigwigs. Let me tell you, with a face like that, I can make big things happen for you. I really mean it. Several reports indicated that the latter portion of the movies plotline focuses on Singer locked in a pulse-pounding race against time to prevent his adolescent self from filing sexual assault charges and destroying his career.</text>

<title>Don Johnson and David Gordon Green to tackle 80s college football  Newswire  The A.V. Club</title>
<text>
In a recent interview with Grantland, Don Johnson revealed his latest project will be a football drama, which Johnson has both written in and will star in, and David Gordon Green (who directed Johnson in several episodes of Eastbound And Down) will direct. Titled Score, the story will follow the rise of college football in the 80s, with Johnson as anoutrageous fucking coach who breaks all the rules, in his own words.

Details are sketchy, as theyve so far been provided only by Johnson, with vague assurances thatIm gonna do it for streaming, and thatI wrote it in October and I wanna get it financed completely. So its hard to tell whether this is a film, a series, or a figment of Johnsons imagination.

In the interview, Johnson also claims to bedoing a thing with Robert Rodriguez, also penned by the actor, about an NSA experiment gone wrong. A man is injected with nanobots, which give himthe computing power and destructive abilities of Deep Blue. Yes, the awesome destructive power of chess-playing mainframe Deep Blue. In this probably-theoretical project, Johnson plays not Gary Kasparov, butan ex-NSA operative who went crazy in the Balkans, and they come get me out of the loony bin when the chess-playing nanobot menacegoes off the fuckin grid.</text>

CHARLOTTESVILLE, VACiting the websites easy navigability, wide variety of lodging options, and ability to filter rentals by price range and neighborhood, Airbnb user Elliot Nofzinger told reporters Monday that he loves how straightforward the service makes it to ejaculate into a perfect strangers sink. Airbnb is greatI just go online, scroll through a few photo albums, read some user reviews, and then boom: Im rubbing one out in the bathroom sink of some guy I dont even know, said the 28-year-old traveler, who went on to add that the simplicity of online booking means that anybody can peruse lodging options one day and be aiming their semen into a sink the very next. Ive been to eight different places and I havent been disappointed yet. You get a nice clean bed, you save a little cash, and you can just grab some of the hosts family photos, line them up on top of the toilet tank, and get to work. Advocates of the site say it is also ideal for hosts who provide accommodations to Airbnb guests, as the service makes it simple to secretly film a diverse array of masturbators.</text>

<title>Report: Growing Number Of Americans Forced To Make Ends Meet By Collaborating On Song With Pitbull</title>
<text>
MIAMIIn a further sign that the sluggish economic recovery continues to pose a challenge to the nations workforce, a report published Wednesday by the U.S. Department of Labor revealed that a growing number of Americans have had to resort to collaborating on songs with Cuban-American rapper Pitbull in order to make ends meet.

The paper, which attributed its findings to stagnant wages and lackluster job growth, confirmed that many poor and middle-class Americans have little choice but to pick up additional work with the chart-topping recording artist, often by contributing backing vocals, writing lyrics, producing Latin-infused beats, or repeatedly shouting the name Pitbull in studio sound booths as a means of providing for their families in this challenging economic climate.

Since the stock market crash and housing sector collapse in 2008, weve seen a staggering increase in the number of Americans who are putting in long, demanding hours behind the mixing console with hip-hop sensation Pitbull, said economist Jared Coan, lead author of the report. While in decades past a single salary was enough to support a family of four, we are now finding that many breadwinners, out of financial necessity, are seeking out additional work laying down guest verses on dance-rap studio tracks like Timber or any one of a number of its club mixes.

Most of these people are working a full day at their 9-to-5 jobs and then heading right into the RCA Records studio to program electronic drums for a PitbullRick Ross collaboration until the early morning, Coan continued. Then, if theyre lucky, they have time to grab a couple hours of sleep before waking up the next day and doing it all over again.

Faced with mounting credit card debt, surging health care costs, and in many cases pricey college tuition for their children, citizens across the country are feeling compelled to supplement their take-home pay by joining Pitbullalso known as Mr. Worldwideon recording dates and the occasional live performance on the Planet Pit World Tour, Coan said. Specifically, survey data indicate that tens of thousands of Americansfrom cashiers and food service workers, to those in formerly solid middle-class jobs, like automotive workers and insurance salespeoplehave to juggle their day jobs with playing claves on a Spanish-language version of Hotel Room Service, spitting freestyle bars alongside guest hip-hop artists such as Flo Rida and T-Pain, and gesticulating toward the camera while filming a music video for I Know You Want Me (Calle Ocho) or Maldito Alcohol.

Furthermore, the report found that many single parents are having to balance their family obligations with the financial necessity of working late nights arranging diss tracks directed against Lil Wayne just to put food on the table, a trend that Coan called all too typical in the current economy.

Over the past seven years, weve seen a steady decline in real median household income in the United States, which corresponds with an equally sharp rise in the number of Americans finding samples for bouncing, house-music-inspired dance hall songs, such as Dont Stop the Party or all the singles off the Meltdown EP, Coan said. And given that rent payments and food and transportation costs have only risen, it appears these individuals will simply have to continue putting in full days at one job and then immediately don white linen suits and open-collar dress shirts so they can shoot a Bud Light commercial alongside Pitbull and his entourage.

When surveyed, most Americans confirmed they had few economic options, and stated that rapping alongside Pitbull was simply something they had to do to scrape by. However, many pointed to the unfulfilling and arduous nature of their efforts, with only a small minority of the respondents saying they receive health insurance or producer credits for their exhausting work with the Latin-American hip-hop artist.

Between my job at a home improvement store, painting houses on the weekends, and shouting Miami Beach through an Auto-Tune filter until Im hoarse, Im barely keeping my head above water, said 42-year-old Michael Erickson of Scottsdale, AZ, who noted that hes grateful to even have the opportunity to pick up a handful of hours with Pitbull every week given the amount of musical collaboration work that lately has gone to overseas workers or Pharrell. Clocking out of my regular job at 5 and then flying off to Las Vegas to serve as Pitbulls hype man at the Billboard Music Awards isnt easy, but its just a sacrifice I have to make if I have any chance of paying off my mortgage.

Its hardI come home late every night soaked in champagne and Im just too exhausted to spend time with my kids, he continued. But the fact is that Im doing this so that someday they wont have to.</text>

<title>3 Sports Scientists Killed Attempting To Harness X Factor</title>
<text>
TULSA, OKPrompting questions over safety standards in similar laboratories across the country, three sports scientists were reportedly left dead and dozens more injured at the University of Tulsa on Tuesday while attempting to harness the X factor. Weve been trying for decades to isolate the elusive X factor in a controlled setting, and in this particular case we were simply calibrating the degree of clutch over various periods of crunch time when everything suddenly went awry, said Dr. Andrew Solzman, one of just two sports scientists to have survived the accident unscathed, having fled the building as soon as measurements of hustle, toughness, and spark began going off the scales. Our goal is of course to reverse-engineer the X factor and one day develop a synthesized version available to athletes across the world. But given its many intangibles, the X factor has proven incredibly unpredictable and unstable, and today we unfortunately saw the devastation it could wreak when not handled properly. In an unconfirmed report, sources also claimed that immediately following the accident, a terrified and completely nude Joe Montana was seen frantically fleeing from the lab wreckage.</text>

<title>Fourth-Grader With Shark Tooth Necklace Must Have Killed Great White</title>
<text>
BRUNSWICK, MEFourth-grade sources reported this week that in order to acquire the shark tooth necklace he wears to school each day, area 10-year-old Brendan Landsley must have killed a great white shark. Brendan probably was in the ocean, saw this huge shark, and then just jumped right on its back, said classmate Ryan Pierson, speculating that Landsley also likely held on to the animals fin and was dragged underwater for miles. Then I bet he took out a knife or a harpoon and stabbed it a bunch of times and ripped the tooth right out of its jaws. Hes probably got a bite mark somewhere from when he was wrestling with it. Schoolyard sources also agreed that sharks probably come nowhere near Landsley anymore when they see the trophy from his kill dangling around his neck.</text>

If the tips work out just right, maybe I could even get my own car and wouldnt have to borrow my parents station wagon anymore. I really hope I get this.

<title>Bored GOP Vetting Rand Paul Just To Kill Time Before Viable 2016 Candidate Emerges</title>
<text>
WASHINGTONCalling the rigorous evaluation process something to do for the time being, bored Republican Party officials told reporters Friday theyve decided to go ahead and vet prospective 2016 presidential contender Rand Paul in order to kill a little time before a viable candidate emerges. Its still pretty early, and honestly we dont have much else to do right now, so we figured we might as well assess Rand Pauls background and political profile until someone who actually has a decent chance of getting elected comes along, said Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, who claimed that, although a thorough appraisal and series of personal interviews would certainly not result in the senator and libertarian-leaning Tea Party member coming anywhere close to the Republican nomination, it would at least provide GOP strategists an interesting, time-consuming endeavor to get them through the next couple months. Obviously, theres not a chance we see the name Rand Paul on the ballot in 2016, but running his political positions by a few focus groups and making sure he doesnt have any dirty laundry that might come up in a hypothetical presidential run is better than just sitting on our hands, you know? To be clear, though, once a halfway appealing centrist whom the American people might actually consider getting behind dips his toes in the water, were dropping this whole Rand Paul thing on the spot. Priebus added that, given the utter lack of legitimate 2016 candidates currently out there, the GOP might vet Ted Cruz as well just for the fuck of it.</text>

<title>Experts Recommend Breaking Down Crushing Defeats Into Smaller, More Manageable Failures</title>

SANTA BARBARA, CAOffering advice to those who feel overwhelmed at the thought of becoming massive failures, a group of experts reported this week that the best way to approach a crippling defeat is to break it down into a set of smaller and more manageable setbacks. The key to failing on a monumental scale is to take life one small misstep at a time, life coach Jack V. Royce told reporters, emphasizing that people who hit absolute rock bottom seldom get there overnight. Just start with a couple of minor fuckups and then build off that. Its all about working through your long, humiliating downward spiral in workable increments: botch this, flub that, make a wreck of something elseand then, before you know it, youre well on your way to being totally screwed. Royce added that its also helpful every now and then to stop, take stock of your situation, and really beat yourself up about it.</text>

<title>Study: Most Serial Killers Did Not Receive Toy Every Time They Went To Store As Kids</title>
<text>
MINNEAPOLISA study published Thursday in The American Journal Of Criminal Psychology has found a nearly perfect statistical correlation between children who were denied a toy they wanted when visiting a store with their parents and the later development of homicidal behavior. We found that even after just one instance of being told no in a toy store aisle, children may begin to exhibit their first violent impulses, which often later manifest as a compulsive need to kill others during adulthood, said forensic psychologist Edgar Pruitt, whose study tracked the emergence of deviant, psychopathic traits that first began to appear when each future killer left a store without a new Nintendo game, G.I. Joe, or remote-control car. John Wayne Gacy, Jeffrey Dahmer, the Green River Killerthese were all people who did not get the toys or games they wanted. So as a parent, you have to ask yourself if the $15 you save by not purchasing Legos or a Spider-Man figurine is worth the potentially dozens of innocent lives your child might one day brutally take. The study also found that young girls who were told they had to eat their dinner before they could have dessert went on in 100 percent of cases to become mothers who drowned their own children one by one in the bathtub.</text>

<title>McDonalds Janitor Would Like To Thank Everyone Who Tossed Half-Full Cups Of Soda Into Trash</title>
<text>
BLOOMINGTON, INIn an effusive display of gratitude toward the local community, McDonalds custodian Kevin Daniels expressed his sincere thanks Wednesday to every customer who has thrown a half-filled cup of soda into any of his workplaces eight trash receptacles. Honestly, I cant say thank you enough to all of you out there for not finishing your large cups of Coke and Dr. Pepper and then just tossing them into the garbage, especially the ones with a lot of iceI appreciate those the most, said Daniels, noting that the multiple times per day he carries a heavy, sloshing, and oftentimes leaking garbage bag to the dumpster behind the restaurant he realizes just how lucky he is. I also want to give special praise to all of you who attempt to cram your soiled napkins and uneaten bits of burgers and Egg McMuffins into cans that are already overflowing. That truly makes my day. And dont let me forget all the times youve smeared ketchup on the flap of the trash can where it dried and needed to be scraped off. Cant wait to see what wonderful surprises the future has in store. Daniels added that given how happy and grateful he is for all that McDonalds customers do for him every day, he felt that it was extremely selfish of him to be making a full $8 an hour.</text>

<title>Prescription Bottle Recommends Taking 10 Tablets If You Really Want To Fly</title>
<text>
BOSTONSources confirmed Wednesday that the label affixed to a bottle of prescription medication recommends that users take three pills daily for optimal medical results or take 10 of them at once if they really want to fly. Take one tablet with water every six hours or pop 10 of these babies in your mouth and blast the fuck off, the bottles label reads in part, adding that the number is an estimate and that users should ultimately base their dosage on how much of a rocket ride they want. Pregnant women and children younger than seven should not use this medication except under careful supervision of a doctor, but if the rest of you wash down 20 of them, youre going to the other end of the cosmos and back. You will see the Truth, and you will become one with it. The label also advises users not to drink alcohol while taking the medication unless they want to softly float around the room.</text>

<title>Nancy Pelosi Rushes Into Living Room To Hear Grandsons First Talking Point</title>
<text>
SAN FRANCISCOSetting down her newspaper at the sound of the young childs voice, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi reportedly rushed into her living room Thursday to hear her grandson say his first talking point. Paul, get in here, I think hes doing it, said Pelosi, who reportedly could barely contain her excitement as the toddler proceeded to sputter through a line about reinvigorating the middle class by opposing tax cuts for Big Oil and corporations that ship jobs overseas. Would you listen to that? He even pronounced special interests correctly. Quick, somebody get the camcorder; I want to be able to save this forever. As of press time, Pelosi was carefully helping her grandson walk back previous comments on Benghazi.</text>

<title>Ron Harper Wont Stop Telling People He Was On Dream Team</title>
<text>
WAYNE, NJHaving insisted on the falsehood for the better part of two decades, sources confirmed Thursday that retired NBA player Ron Harper wont stop telling people that he was on the national mens basketball Dream Team that brought home the gold medal for the U.S. in 1992. Man, well never again have a group of superstars like we did in 92; Im just proud to have been a part of it, the journeyman shooting guard reportedly told his checkout clerk at a local Stop & Shop earlier this week, adding his oft-repeated claim that being selected as a starter for that squad was the biggest honor of [his] life. That team was something else: Magic, Jordan, Bird, Barkley, and me, manning the perimeter. We were unstoppable. Granted, what we accomplished in 96 was pretty great too, but nothing can ever come close to that summer in Barcelona. According to sources, the former athlete was later heard regaling a toll booth operator about his legendary flu game during the 1997 NBA Finals, in which a severely ill Harper improbably managed to score 38 points en route to a Chicago Bulls victory.</text>

<title>Bored GOP Vetting Rand Paul Just To Kill Time Before Viable 2016 Candidate Emerges</title>
<text>
WASHINGTONCalling the rigorous evaluation process something to do for the time being, bored Republican Party officials told reporters Friday theyve decided to go ahead and vet prospective 2016 presidential contender Rand Paul in order to kill a little time before a viable candidate emerges. Its still pretty early, and honestly we dont have much else to do right now, so we figured we might as well assess Rand Pauls background and political profile until someone who actually has a decent chance of getting elected comes along, said Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, who claimed that, although a thorough appraisal and series of personal interviews would certainly not result in the senator and libertarian-leaning Tea Party member coming anywhere close to the Republican nomination, it would at least provide GOP strategists an interesting, time-consuming endeavor to get them through the next couple months. Obviously, theres not a chance we see the name Rand Paul on the ballot in 2016, but running his political positions by a few focus groups and making sure he doesnt have any dirty laundry that might come up in a hypothetical presidential run is better than just sitting on our hands, you know? To be clear, though, once a halfway appealing centrist whom the American people might actually consider getting behind dips his toes in the water, were dropping this whole Rand Paul thing on the spot. Priebus added that, given the utter lack of legitimate 2016 candidates currently out there, the GOP might vet Ted Cruz as well just for the fuck of it.</text>

<title>James Cameron Says Future Of Movies Will Be Watching Them Sitting On His Lap</title>
<text>
LOS ANGELESCalling his latest innovation the mediums most exciting advancement in years, Academy Awardwinning film pioneer James Cameron said Friday the future of movies would be watching them while sitting on his lap.

Cameron, the keynote speaker at a film technology conference held at the University of Southern California, delivered a 45-minute presentation to industry experts detailing the state-of-the-art experience of viewing a feature-length motion picture atop his lap, which he said would revolutionize cinema as we know it.

Within the next five to 10 years, nearly every major Hollywood movie will be watched from my lap, Cameron said following a presentation that featured a 3D rendering of the Titanic director seated in a theater chair with moviegoers of various ages taking turns sitting down on his hips and leaning back against his torso. It will not just be the most immersive, thrilling, and groundbreaking way to experience the craft of filmit will surely be the most personal.

Ladies and gentlemen, this is the future! Cameron added while patting his upper thigh.

The Hollywood mogul went on to outline a number of the highly specialized features he foresees as part of his lap-based movie experience, including the 59-year-old clinging tightly to viewers during a movies most suspenseful scenes, cradling them gently in his arms during emotional moments, and placing a warm blanket over any audience member who falls asleep on him.

According to Cameron, the three upcoming sequels to Avatar will all be filmed to maximize the experience of sitting on [his] lap, and will include an audio commentary option that allows him to whisper his perspectives on filmmaking into the viewers ear throughout each movie.

The warmth of my body and my breath against peoples necks will one day be as integral to a movie as its cinematography or sound design, said Cameron, explaining that his team is also in the process of testing a home-theater system that will allow him to arrive at viewers doors holding a bag of popcorn and wearing a comfortable pair of sweatpants. I think as soon as people watch a favorite like The Wizard Of Oz on my lap, theyll say to themselves, Wow, thats how this movie was always meant to be experiencedon Jim Camerons lap.

So far, Cameron explained, only a handful of test audiences have been able to view movies on his lap, including his wife, his four children, his personal assistant, and producer Harvey Weinstein. Just before the end of his speech, however, the Canadian filmmaker offered to give a few conference attendees a limited preview of the experience.

I tried it out and it was a little weird at first, but after about five minutes or so, I got used to it, said Sam Heinrichs, one of a dozen participants selected to sit on Camerons lap and watch a 20-minute clip from Terminator 2 immediately following the directors presentation. James was very accommodating, and he even told me Watch this! before all the good parts.

His lap was actually pretty comfortable, Heinrichs added. I could definitely see myself watching another movie on top of him.

Industry experts said Camerons latest innovation could prove even more popular than Terrence Malicks attempt to revolutionize the theatrical experience by having audiences sit alone in a completely empty field for weeks on end with no movie playing.</text>
