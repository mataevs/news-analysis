The system called The Road to Glory is a detailed set of rules that outlines exactly how many points one needs to achieve salvation, as well as many holy waypoints along the journey.

 

 "It's fantastic," says John McCork, a 24 year old layperson, "I finally can understand the true ramifications of my actions on my holy life. If I steal from work, minus 300 points. If I follow the pope on twitter, plus 20 points per week. This is exactly what I needed."

 Experts agree, the Catholic Church needs to reach out to younger people, and The Road to Glory promises to be just the thing. With a solid point system, leader boards, IOS and Android apps, Road to Glory will appeal to a younger set of technologically minded youth, often considered unreachable by traditional religious practice.</text>

Embattled Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio vehemently denied today that his department engages in racial profiling because he profiles everyone regardless of race, country of origin, sexual orientation or political preference. "It just looks like we profile Hispanics because there are so damned many of them in Arizona", Arpaio stated. "We are on the lookout for all foreigners. For example, if one of my men stops a person with a funny French accent and that person smells bad then that person will be asked for immigration papers. The same goes for them funny sounding British folks or anyone with a funny accent".

 

 Arpaio claims he is simply trying to weed out the foreigners from "regular Americans". 

 

 "I don't care if they're weed smoking, pinko lesbians so long as they're here legally! Of course, if they do have weed on them then they can expect to wear pink panties and sweat their asses off!" Arpaio stated in reference to his jailhouse policy of requiring all male and female inmates to wear only pink underwear while incarcerated outside in 120 degree temperatures.

 

 "The worst ones are some of them Canadians", Arpaio continued. "A lot of them sound like Americans. You gotta listen real close cause they ask questions with the word 'eh'. Like one will say 'you're going to the store, eh?'"

 

 Though the overwhelming number of illegal immigrants Arpaio's officers stop are Mexican, Arpaio claims he has also detained a number of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, German and French.

 

 "One of my officers pulled over a lady late one morning for driving with a headlight out and my guy knew right away that she was French.

 

 Officer Larry Paige, the officer Arpaio mentioned, recalled the incident clearly. "The lady was driving with a French license which I think is illegal in Arizona", Paige stated. "When I asked her where she was going she said 'I am going to ze Grand Canyawn'. I took her in and booked her a flight right back to France!"

 

 Paige said her realized there is no law against driving with a headlight out in the morning hours but this gave him an opportunity to "weed out crime and illegal immigrants".

 

 "Sometimes we even stop God fearing, white, American Republicans", Arpaio stated. "But we always let them go."

 

 Arpaio says he hopes he can clear his own name to avoid wearing pink underwear and swelter outside in 120 degree temperatures.</text>

When he was first nominated to head the Supreme Court by the then leader of our nation, George W. Bush, I wrote the following piece on Chief Justice John Roberts. In light of his recent vote on The Affordable Care Act, (Obamacare), I'd like to apologize for saying the following: 

 (Dated 2005-07-24) 

 "White House Releases Complete Dossier on Supreme Court Nominee John G. Roberts"

 

 The White House, facing growing pressure to release documents and information concerning the legal opinions of Supreme Court nominee John G. Roberts, has released the following biography of the DC District Court Judge:

 

 "John Roberts was born on the edge of what was at that time the American wilderness, in a small, hand hewn, two room log cabin. Growing up, he read law books that he found in the dumpster of the local Wal Mart; of course, this delving into jurisprudence had to wait until he had slopped the hogs, tweezed the chicken droppings from the living room carpet and skimmed the pool. However, these back-breaking chores did nothing to discourage the young legal savant from pursuing his dreams of not legislating from the bench of the highest court in the land, even though his personal opinions differed widely from that law.

 

 By the time he became a teenager Roberts had accumulated an impressive collection of sixteen masters degrees in subjects ranging from Bio-ethics to Advanced Auto Maintenance and Repair, as well as a disturbingly large collection of Barbie and Ken dolls, which he would pose in unspeakable positions. Thankfully, this proved to (be) just a phase however, and by the time he reached the age of twenty one Mr. Roberts had joined the United States Army, Navy, Air Force and Kiwanis Club. Retiring at the age of twenty three with the rank of Admiral General Pro Consul, John went back to pursue his original dream of becoming the first Supreme Court Justice with more than three hundred Barbie and Ken dolls. Sadly, Antonin Scalia's appointment to the Court destroyed this goal.

 

 During a bout of depression caused by Scalia's appointment, John checked himself into the Betty Ford Clinic and three months later emerged Barbie-less and sober. After working for years in the Regan and Bush the Elder Administrations issuing legal opinions that no one in the White House seems to want to talk about, Roberts was appointed to the DC Court.

 

 During private conversations with lawmakers from both sides of the aisle that had been secretly recorded by the White House, Roberts has been heard to say, "Writ...Habeas Corpus...gavel.", proving that he is eminently capable of sitting on the highest court in the land. 

 

 Based on the information provided by the White House, this publication had chosen to support his nomination to the Supreme Court and eventual anointing to Kingship</text>

The Supreme Court of the United States, has issued their ruling on Arizona's controversial tough immigration law. But in addition to striking down most of the law's key provisions, also included waaay in the back, was a little surprise- Arizona is no longer a part of the United States. In fact, it now belongs to television's iconic "Dog Whisperer", Cesar Millan. While the five to three ruling, with Justice Anthony Kennedy writing for the majority and Justice whoever for the minority, was supposed to address Governor Jan Brewer and the Arizona Legislature's attempt to put in place what some (hell, what a whole lot of Americans) saw as racial profiling, a variant of DWB (Driving While Black), but with the added pressure of being not just thrown in jail, but thrown out of the country if proper proof of American citizenship or green card...uh, ship, couldn't be established. And that's where the trouble began. 

 

 The Chief Justice may be John Roberts, but the title of Chief Scamp undoubtedly belongs to Ruth Bader Ginsberg, or at least one of her law clerks. While reading the Arizona brief, Justice Ginsberg allegedly shook her head and muttered, "This country's going to the dogs." Justice Kennedy then chuckled, "We should turn the state into one big kennel. That would solve the problem right there." That innocuous exchange should have been the end of it, but of course, it wasn't.

 

 When the Supreme Court's ruling was issued today, someone had apparently taken Ginsberg's and Kennedy's comments to heart, because at the very end of the majority decision was the final sentence: "It is therefore determined the that the state of Arizona, including all it's lands public and private, shall be given to "Dog Whisperer", Cesar Millan, to be used as a kennel.". 

 

 Anthony Kennedy apparently missed the final sentence, which was on the last page and separated from the rest of the decision by a bunch of smiley emoticons (a tradition of his at the end of decisions written by him). So while that part wasn't actually read out loud, it was entered into the record as law.

 

 Cesar Millan, while shocked, was reported to be ecstatic, saying, "And I thought my new place outside LA was cool, but man, think of what I can do with 114006 square miles, especially with that great fence on the southern border already in place. Now all's I have to do is get all the people who don't own dogs outta there and we're set." 

 

 Former Governor Jan Brewer and the Arizona legislators who signed HB 2780,the bill to exempt ranch dogs from cruelty laws, have reportedly gone into hiding, as Mr. Milllan has vowed to run them off his land at the first opportunity, along with anyone who supported the bill. 

 

 Still, the whole thing, which undoubtedly started out as a joke, does present some interesting legal ramifications, to wit: once the highest court in the land makes a determination, can it be overturned, even by them? Can they just say, "Boy, that was pretty stupid, we take it back"? If so, while it's too late for Bush v Gore, then there's still hope for Citizens United. And secondly, would the rest of the country want them to? After all, I for one would take Cesar Millan over Jan Brewer any day. And the irony of giving the whole damn state to a Mexican-American is just too delicious. 

 

 Of course, turning 114006 square miles of American soil into a vast non-profit organization would present some revenue shortfalls, but Mr. Millan promises to allow animal lovers to stay and keep their homes on a long term lease situation and vows to make them pay all relevent property taxes. As well, the Greenies Company has already proposed installing a massive manufacturing facility for the former State House with offices in the former Governors mansion...both projects are guaranteed to be far more productive than what's going on on those sites now. Other dog food and pet supply companies are also presenting proposals to Mr. Millan to take over various state government sites. 

 

 So, congratulations Mr. Millan and good luck on your new venture. Keep your tail up and your nose to the wind. And if any of your doggie friends happen to bite Ms.Brewer, don't worry- she should never have been there in the first place and apparently, no court in the land would convict you.</text>

Okay, I admit it- I've been busy and haven't really been paying attention. But I woke up this morning and realized, 'Jeez, it's 2012! That means there must be an election coming up.' Funny how these things sneak up on you. For those of you who, like me, haven't noticed, it goes like this- apparently Barack Obama is still our president and some guy named Mitt Romney wants to take his place. I hadn't heard till just now. That's what comes from not watching TV. Like I say, I've been busy, okay? So, as a public service for people like me, I'll recap the last twelve or so years in order for you to make a well-informed choice at the polls in November: 2000-2008: George W. Bush won the presidency in 2000 by just nine votes (that would be the Supreme Court to you and me), making it the nation's closest election. Ever. Nine months later, while he was reading children's books to kindergarteners, Saudi Arabian terrorists attacked America. In response, W. attacked (rightly) Afghanistan, who was harboring the terrorists, and (weirdly) Iraq, who, despite having an evil dictator, had nothing to do with it. At all. The logic was that Iraq had Weapons of Mass Destruction, which we were certain of, as the president's father, Bush the Elder, had sold them to the Iraqis back in the 80's and 90's.

 

 A massive search for the objects of these two wars, the WMDs and Osama bin Laden, along with the 340 tons of explosives that we did find during the initial invasion of Iraq but promptly forgot about, yielded nothing (...well, almost nothing. We did keep finding bits and pieces of the 340 tons of munitions scattered about various roadsides throughout Iraq, which we then called IEDs (Improvised Explosive Devices)to make them sound more military, but which were really just fucking bombs).

 

 Anyway, America didn't care too much at the beginning of the Iraq invasion because we all saw some really cool video of stuff blowing up on TV; it wasn't until our people started blowing up too that we began to take notice. But in our defense, we had other things to distract us...our homes were increasing in value, seemingly exponentially, and we were really busy sorting through the offers from various banks to loan us money against them. So, in order to stop them from pestering us, we borrowed (and borrowed and borrowed) from the poor little dears. Kids...I mean, what're you gonna do? We changed the slogan from 'BUY AMERICAN' to 'BUY, AMERICA!' and used all the money to buy crap from China. George Bush pointed proudly to the millions of jobs he created (in Mexico, India, China and Vietnam) with the support of venture capitalist companies with names like Bain (Bane?) who compassionately thought Americans were working too hard and so shipped their jobs overseas to give them a break.

 

 2008- After eight years of borrowing money from China to fund a couple of wars and refusing to raise the money to repay the loans, capitalist America under Dubya found itself in the odd and rather ironic position of being deeply in debt to a communist country. Then one morning all the bankers woke up and realized, "Shit! We're broke too!" and promptly went to their Uncle Sam to get 'bailed out'. To help things along, the stock market went into panic mode and crashed as well. Uncle George, uh, Sam, signed TARP into law, then let the bankers keep taking huge bonuses while they foreclosed on Americans homes. It was a happy time (if you were a banker), but regular Americans were troubled... something to do with losing their homes, life savings and all that crap they'd bought from China (You just can't help some people, I swear). 

 

 

 Coincidentally, it was an election year too. In a burst of self-loathing, Americans decided it was time to rectify the mistake we called Dubya and elect someone with an actual IQ. The GOP, who had put up as candidates Arizona Senator John McCain and Alaska Governor Sarah Palin (figuring, 'Oh what the hell, why not? After all, who'll notice?') were caught off guard by this sudden, if temporary, burst of realistic thinking on the part of voters, who elected a Black man with the traitorous name of Barack Hussein Obama and who promised to give them affordable healthcare, to disengage from Iraq and help struggling American industries like auto manufacturers. 

 

 But the GOP (Greedy Old People) weren't beaten yet. Within weeks, Rush Limbaugh was blaming everything the GOP did under Bush on the new president and openly advocating against the leader of our country, asking, "What's wrong with wanting the President to fail?", perhaps forgetting that if the President failed then the country would stay in deep shit. Americans were appalled when they realized that 'Affordable Healthcare" meant you still actually had to pay something for it. Catholic bishops complained about birth control, rightly pointing out that since their priests only diddled little boys who couldn't even get pregnant, they shouldn't have to be forced to pay for contraception. It just wasn't fair. 

 

 Wall Street bankers, who donated tons of cash to the Obama campaign in 2008 and figured the fix was in, were appalled when the President actually suggested regulations to stop them from being so fucking stupid and Tea Party wisely put on tri-corn hats, funny noses and started going into Starbucks armed to the teeth. A good time was had by all (except the nervous Starbucks baristas).

 

 The Republican led Congress, whose approval rating has skyrocketed from 10% to 17% in 2012 alone, led the charge against the President's attempts at helping Americans by aggressively doing nothing except voting against every measure the Democrats put forward, then rightly complaining that Mr. Obama had gotten nothing done in his first term, except for killing bin Laden and a bunch of other terrorists, which only pissed the GOP off; after all, making a killing was their job. 

 

 Then, to counter Mr. Obama's exotic background and after a bruising primary season, they put forth a candidate (now we're talking about Mitt Romney here...please keep up), a deeply religious man whose belief system includes the idea that God lives on the planet (or a planet that circles around a star called...I keep getting that confused) Kolub, that Jesus was just one god among many and every Mormon (males only, please) becomes gods themselves when they die, American Indians were actually the Lost Tribes of Israel and that the Garden of Eden was someplace near Kansas City, Missouri. And if that weren't enough, he avows, "Corporations are people, my friend." (although admittedly it is hard to punch one in the jaw). 

 

 A pratical man, Mitt Rmoney is, who believes we should've just let the entire American auto industry go bankrupt and reorganize (in China). But still, a modest man who only has inexpensive high-end Cadillac's at both his mansions, presumably because all those horses cost so much to maintain. In other words, a Man (of 1%) Of The People. A teetotaler and a pure man who apparently believes it's God's will that he take millions in campaign contributions derived from overseas gambling joints. Forget Kenya, for exoticism you can't beat that (And by the way, what the hell kinda name is Mitt anyway? I mean, if your dad was Mickey Mantle or Babe Ruth I could see it, but Mitt? Thank god...who I'll be myself if I become a Mormon with the proper Temple Reccomend before I die...my dad stuck me with Chuck, nasty rhymes notwithstanding). 

 

 So, that's America today in a nutshell, which is a fitting phrase, since at least half of us are completely nuts. I'll keep you posted on how it turns out, so don't worry about paying attention. I'm back on the case. Thank you, and goodnight.</text>

Just hours after saying the private sector is "doing fine" President Obama admitted that the private sector actually sucks and most people are forced to "bite the big one". "I realized after my speech that the economy sucks, people are unemployed and things are much shittier than I though", Obama admitted. "I talked to my advisers before the speech and they told me everything was just great. From now on I will read the newspaper before I make a speech".

 

 The President was forced to make this rare admission after Republican rival Mitt Romney claimed the president was "out of touch" on the issues and tried to use the president's ignorance for his own political gain.

 

 "I read the paper every day", Romney stated. "I KNEW things sucked before Obama knew it!"

 

 Romney also said that if he's elected he will bring gas prices down to $1.89 per gallon, eliminate personal income taxes, eliminate the federal deficit and make every U.S. Citizen happy.

 

 "I guarantee you will love me when I am elected!" Romney said with a smile. "Don't vote for that ignoramus! Vote for me!"</text>

Elroy Jenkins a 32 year old Midland, Michigan construction worker, claims that the remarkable transit of the sun by the planet Venus did not impress him at all. "Big deal!" Jenkins exclaimed. "You see a little speck moving across the sun. Big woop dee doo! I get more thrills watching golf on TV. And I hate watching golf!"

 

 Scientists claim that Venus will not transit the sun for another 105 years thus making this a last-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Still, Jenkins expressed little interest. "Is Venus in front of the sun going to make me richer? Will it put food on the table? Will it make me a better person? Hell no!"

 

 It would appear that Jenkins is not the only one unimpressed by the celestial wonder. Mary Phibbs of Toledo, OH was also unmoved. "I could just put my hand in front of my face and tell everyone, 'hey look! My hand is transiting the sun!' I think that would be even more impressive".</text>

Trump's tablet will sport a 10.1-inch display, NVIDIA's Tegra 250 1GHz dual core processor, is just over half an inch thick and weighs 1.69 pounds. It includes 16GB of storage, built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, HDMI-out, an SD card reader, a 5 megapixel and a 2 megapixel camera, GPS, and Trump claims it has a 10-hour battery life.

 

 In comparison, Apple's 16GB Wi-Fi iPad 2 costs $499, includes a 9.7-inch display, Apple's own A5 1GHz dual core processor, is .34-inches thick, and weighs 1.33 pounds. The entry-level iPad includes 16GB storage, built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, a dock connector that supports HDMI-out, front and rear-facing cameras that support less than 1 megapixel resolution, and a 10-hour battery life.

 

 The Bloviating Ignoramus A500 can take advantage of the Android Marketplace for third party apps, but it doesn't support Apple's App Store or the iTunes Store, nor does it offer the same overall user experience Apple offers with its iOS ecosystem.

 

 While Trump may have a few more features in his tablet, it doesn't offer the same user-friendly experience Apple has created for the iPad, and that may be harder to overcome than Trump anticipates.</text>

<title>Conservationists Fear Dwindling Park Space Reduces Places Kids Can Safely Get High</title>
<text>
In a letter to the Obama administration published today, naturalists and conservationists expressed a growing concern that chronic reduction of the nation's parks and open spaces is limiting the safe areas that America's children have to go and get stoned.

"For decade, our nation's youth could count on a darkened baseball diamond or an abandoned picnic shelter when they wanted to smoke a bowl safely, without worrying about crashing a moving car or getting caught by Dad walking into the basement," read the letter, published in the latest issue of High Times and on FoxNews.com.

"Now, with these havens disappearing thanks to budget crises, we're pushing our children further into dark, dangerous forests -- or even inner-city neighborhoods -- for just a few tokes."

The authors of the letter, including Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, argue that local and state governments are "mortgaging our children's futures just to save a few bucks."

"Wall Street elitists got us into this financial mess, but they're still rich, so their kids continue to have the means to get high in peace," said Brune. "But while they're taking advantage of their wealthy parents' lengthy vacations away from home, or their kickass backyards with lots of places to hide so the weed smell won't drift back into the kitchen, the children of hard-working, normal Americans are forced to do their drugs in more and more dangerous situations."

"It's a crime," he said, shaking his head sadly.

Without a safe, secluded place for 14-18 year-olds to get high, American society could soon begin to suffer, say experts.

"When a typical suburban teen trips acid at a park and begins to scream 'LOOK AT THOSE SAVAGE MONKEYS TRYING TO KILL ME,' he's in no real danger," explained Dr. Thad Norton, professor of sociology at Boston University. "But if he does the same thing in an urban environment, he could wind up in a whole mess of trouble."

Parents share the concerns of experts and conservationists, and are doing their best to think of ways to protect their children while they're doing drugs.

"Time was, you'd just head up to the river for a little cush, or maybe on top of some hilltop overlooking a nice lush valley," reminisced Clayton Sawtooth, a parent in Philadelphia, PA, at a recent PTA meeting. "Now, that kind of stuff is disappearing. It's almost enough to make me just let my kid smoke up at home, where he's safe."

Sawtooth hastily added that he would never do that, because his son needs to believe that doing drugs is terrible and wrong, and requires sneaking around into dangerous places.</text>

<title>Area Man's Use Of Pay Phone Angers, Confuses Coworkers</title>
<text>
Local man Allen Withrow became the subject of ridicule and the focus of extreme anger this past Friday, when he used a non-cellular fee-based public telephone device -- or "pay phone" -- to make a personal call.

The event occurred at a local bar during an office happy hour, when Withrow excused himself from his coworkers to go to the pay phone at the back of the bar. He somehow used a thick paper binding near the phone to assist him in calling the home of his friend, stunning his peers.

"He literally stood up, walked across the entire bar, opened that book and dialed a number," said Bill Watkins, one of Withrow's coworkers. "It was literally one of the strangest, most 1980s actions I've ever seen."

Withrow's coworker Angela Williams, who was also upset by Withrow's use of the device, commented, "I understand if you don't like the twenty-first century or whatever, but you can't just go on living without a cell phone. It's physically impossible."

Julius Boortz, regional manager at Withrow's office, agreed, and is now reconsidering Withrow's employment with the company.

"Unacceptable," he said, with disgust in his eyes. "Think about how nasty those phones are -- you can catch AIDS from them. Just compare that to my phone." He proudly displayed his cell phone screen, which was covered with fingerprints, faint swipes of nacho cheese, and ear grease.

"And how are you supposed to check your email?" Boortz added scornfully. "With coins? No way, Jos."

Withrow says he has resisted such social pressure to purchase a cell phone by simply not realizing how necessary portable phones are, or even how they physically exist.

"To be honest, I don't really even know what you're talking about," he said. "You mean a phone I carry with me all the time? With computer chips inside it? That's absurd."

When asked, Withrow can produce -- purely from memory -- the phone numbers of all of his closest friends and family members; without a cell phone to remember such information, he is forced to store it in his own brain. Experts have generally agreed that remembering phone numbers is a waste of mental capacity, and may even be dangerous.

"Normal human beings have devices called 'cell phones' attached to their bodies at all times," said Dr. Wylie Smatterton, a researcher at a prestigious local community college. "Without the healthy doses of electromagnetic radiation these devices provide, it's impossible to say how a person would function. Certainly, the ability to recklessly drive a car or enjoy texting a friend during a movie would be impaired."

Withrow's niece, 13-year old Alisa Burns, has known about her uncle's strange ways for years. She condemned his actions as "bizarre" and "outdated."

"Uncle Allen lives alone, has no kids, collects things, and probably only has fun when he cleans," she said while simultaneously texting her friends, Facebook-friending 8,000 people, taking a photo of herself from above and slightly to the right, and completing her history book report. "Without a cell phone, really, he's basically just waiting to die."</text>

<title>LeBron James Announces Plan To Follow In Jordan's Footsteps, Play For Birmingham Barons Minor League Squad</title>
<text>
In a move that has stunned Cleveland fans, but surprised very few sportswriters, NBA free agent LeBron James announced tonight that he will not return to the Cleveland Cavaliers, choosing instead to follow in the footsteps of his hero Michael Jordan and play for minor league baseball squad the Birmingham Barons for the rest of 2010.

The two-time league MVP used a three hour TV special to say that his time with the AA ball team will begin immediately.

"As much as it hurts to say, everyone should have seen it coming," said Terry Pluto of the Akron-Beacon Journal. "It comes as no surprise that in order to be named along with legends like Larry Bird, Magic Johnson and, of course, Michael Jordan, James feels that he has to leave Cleveland, where nothing short of a three-peat would establish the legacy he's after. Which will never ever happen, even if the Cavs got Chris Bosh, because, well, it's Cleveland."

Tony Kornheiser, host of ESPN's Pardon The Interruption, says that this is James' best chance to finally best Jordan.

"If he can prove that his defense is better than Jordan's 11 errors, and that he's better than three home runs on the year against bush-league pitchers, then he'll have toppled Jordan in at least one sport," said Kornheiser. "This is the one thing that Jordan never did: batting above .250 for the season in farm-league baseball."

Co-host Mike Wilbon responded, "You... no... no, you don't do that... no, but... okay, time's up  next up, the 2010 MLB All Star Game: will anyone know if FOX runs a Glee re-run instead?"

Some, however, have questioned the logic of James' decision, which, they argue, has very little to do with attaining a legacy as the greatest basketball player of all time.

Indeed, some expect that he will spend only a year or two in the minors, eventually returning to basketball in time to receive the Charles Barkley Honorary Championship Trophy.

Bizarrely, Cleveland fans say they feel betrayed by the hometown hero from Akron, despite the fact that they should be well trained by now to expect terrible disappointment from their sports teams.

"Sure, we've had [sports blunders such as] The Drive, The Shot, The Fumble, and Jose Mesa," said Cleveland-area resident and Cavs fan Mike Taranto, "but I thought for sure that this was going to be different. I guess King James doesn't care."

"Maybe I'll move to Florida," Taranto said. "At least it's warm down there. You're always hearing about that 'Miami heat'."</text>

<title>Anti-Incumbent Sentiment In Washington Kills Senator Robert Byrd :: The Enduring Vision</title>
<text>
Senator Robert Byrd (D-WV), the longest serving member of Congress, became the most recent casualty of an increasingly tumultuous election year when he died this morning.

Fueled by the West Virginia Tea Party, a political party that aims to restore sanity to Washington by electing people who are largely insane, widespread anti-incumbent sentiment caused Byrd to become seriously ill, and eventually, dead.

"As of 3AM today, Senator Byrd is no more," said a statement read by Byrd spokesman Jesse Jacobs. "Voters have made their voices loud this year, and the death of Senator Byrd is a direct result of it."

Byrd was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1852, where he served sixty years before moving to the U.S. Senate. He was elected to an unprecedented ninetieth term in 2006, and has cast over 1.2 million votes during his illustrious, 182-year career.

A former member of the Ku Klux Klan, Byrd was a proud supporter of the secession of the Confederate States of America from the Union, but later backtracked on his position when he impregnated four of his female slaves.

He originally became famous in the late 1700s for chastising the Whigs for their support of a centralized monetary system, which he wrote "doth make knaves of us al [sic]". He was challenged to a duel by Lord Hastingsbury for his outspoken critique of the monarchy, but the match was canceled due to an illness overcoming Hastingsbury's mother, the Duchess of Chichestonsbridge.

Many conservative leaders cheered Byrd's death, saying that it serves as proof that the country's current leaders are literally killing America -- and, by extension, themselves.

"Every seat is the people's seat," said Agnes Oldham, a leader of the Charleston, West Virginia Tea Party. "What Senator Byrd forgot is that at any time, We the People can take back our seat -- by causing illness and death. Which was caused by him...being un-American!"

However, critics of the Tea Party movement, such as political and sports commentator Keith Olbermann, have condemned the illness as "politics as usual," and calling for a recount of Byrd's vital signs.

"Wake up, America," said Olbermann on his syndicated talk show, where he routinely lambastes Fox News and its subsidiary, the Republican Party. "In a time when war, healthcare and Wall Street reform are on the minds of every American, the GOP has only one thing on its mind: illness and death. Is this the future we want for our children? A future of illness and death?"

Olbermann then stared somberly at the camera, stroking his penis softly, and said, "Good night...and good luck."

There is one group of people who are tremendously excited by the Senator's death: potential West Virginia Senate candidates. Former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich is expected to hold an auction for the vacant seat, though the West Virginia Tea Party has already registered 412 candidates for the upcoming election.

"Remember, every seat belongs to an American," continued Agnes Oldham, "which basically means that each and every seat in Congress is a real American person. And I promise you, no one gets into Agnes Oldham without a fight."</text>

When the Internet was first created, top experts at the time predicted that nobody would ever use it to watch video. At the time, the word "YouTube" referred to a device that piped people directly into U2 concerts. Now, those experts are dead from the shame of being wrong, and YouTube is a type of straw or something.

The point is, watching videos online is popular now, so we made some. See below.</text>

Another letters update? That makes two in one month! What the hell is this, some kind of operational website? Top scientists are working on the answer. We are paying them with the money from our super-lucrative text ads. Anyway, let's see what you have to say!

I am aghast to discover the return of the EV. You have failed in your correspondence with me, Mr.Dorito of the Dorito company. Now you will not receive that lifetime supply of ORIGINAL Doritos that I promised you so many years ago. - MrDoritooftheDoritocompany

Josh: You! I always knew you would return one day, so I *KILLS YOU*

Where is that bullshit smell coming from? I know, the person who wrote this bs. - Liar

Josh: I would point out that according to your name -- your very own name that you voluntarily signed, sir! -- it is you who is a liar. You lose!

O'Rielly needs to take his own advice, he has rants like a little baby is his style of delivery for his show - Roderick

Josh: You've clearly missed the point of the article.

Hilarious presentation. Also, FNM is from San Francisco, as I am sure you realize. - Lola

Josh: This letter is an important lesson for all readers: if you do not use the cool comment button at the bottom of articles, and instead use our general contact form, we will have no idea what you are talking about. (Sorry, Lola.)

You are very stupid to wrote this shit.Next time try to find something more intelligent. - alexandra

Josh: Argh, if only we knew what shit you were talking about! Then we would probably say, "Good point, alexandra. We are stupid to wrote that shit."

oh my heavens! This made me laugh harder than anything lately! Thank you for this article. It's soooo true and hilarious at the same time. I'm engaged to a felon. We met while he was incarcerated.

<title>U.S. Identifies Vast Deposits Of Unobtainium In Afghanistan</title>
<text>
U.S. and Afghan officials claim to have discovered more than $1,000 trillion in untapped unobtainium deposits in Afghanistan, far beyond any previously known reserves and enough to fundamentally alter the Afghan economy -- and perhaps the war itself, according to senior American military officials.

Unobtainium is one of the rarest and most unobtainable minerals in the universe, previously only thought to exist inside the uncreative mind of movie director James Cameron. It sells for upwards of $20 million per kilogram, and tends to be guarded by "stupid, uneducated, savage peoples that don't understand its value," according to Marine Corps Colonel Steven Quaritch.

"Typically, the only way to obtain unobtainium is to blow up the savages protecting it, because for some reason they always live right on top of it," said Quaritch, who is leading the invasion of the ground below Afghanistan. "Luckily, though, we have been doing just that for nine years now already!"

The reserves of unobtainium, theoretically obtainable by modern mining methods, remain untapped by the people of Afghanistan. According to a poll of Americans, this is primarily because they ride around on camels and do not even speak any known language.

Mr. Whitman McWhiterman, chairman and CEO of Invasion Mining, Inc., was ecstatic about the discovery. "Finally, I will be rich," said Mr. McWhiterman. "Finally, once we've rid the world of these pesky Afghan creatures, we'll be able to mine and obtain all of this unobtainium."

"It is a complete waste," continued Col. Quaritch, "that this super-duper important mineral, which we Americans need, is just sitting over there with no one mining it. It's only fair that we get our fair share."

Others, however, were not so optimistic about the ability of America to obtain the unobtainium.

Sigourney Weaver, the actress best known for her performance as Marcia Lawton on the television series 3 By Cheever, was not confident about the discovery. "At a time of growing despair about Afghanistan and its government," she said during a phone interview with the EV, "the portrayal of the country as a potential or unobtainium mine -- or goldmine, as it were -- could help to attract mercenaries and dispossessed soldiers in an attempt to destroy that large tree in which all Afghan people live."

Weaver is referring to "Home Tree", which according to U.S. intelligence is both the world's largest tree and the Mecca for all Islamic peoples in the world. Reports indicate that all Afghan citizens live in Home Tree, which is located directly above the unobtainium deposit.

"At the core of Home Tree is the Kaaba, a large black cube around which each Muslim must walk seven times, in a counter-clockwise direction," said an unnamed senior intelligence official. "it is through the Kaaba that each Muslim can actually communicate with the unobtainium deposit -- accomplished by attaching their tails directly to the Kaaba."

Removing the Afghans from Home Tree may be extremely difficult, but most American leaders are not worried.

"Once we find out what the blue monkeys want, it will be easy," concluded McWhiterman. "Even people as backwards as the ones in Afghanistan should be able to see the obvious by now: they can't avoid joining real civilization forever."</text>

<title>BP Points Out That Oil Spill Could Give Rise To Toxic Avenger Style Superhero</title>
<text>
As President Obama prepares to address the nation about the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, spill perpetrator BP is trying to emphasize the disaster's positive aspects -- namely, that it creates conditions favorable to the development of a mutant superhero.

In a press conference today, BP spokesperson Dan Snow reminded journalists that the cult classic hero Toxic Avenger arose out of toxic waste -- a close cousin of oil.

"We all know the story of how lovable Melvin Junko went from 98 lbs. of solid nerd to fearsome crime-fighting 'Monster Hero' -- all thanks to some perfectly natural toxic waste," Snow said. "It's possible, if not probable, that someone will eventually encounter our oil, and undergo a similar transformation. Perhaps even the exact same transformation."

Once mutated, Snow explained that this hypothetical hero would be able to finally put an end to "the criminal politicians who allowed us to allow this spill to happen in the first place."

"That being said," Snow added, "after seeing all the good it brought everyone, the public would probably want the oil spill to stick around -- pun definitely intended, because once that stuff touches something, like a rock or a couple of baby ducklings, it's never coming off!"

Snow also revealed that BP is internally producing a script for a CGI film based on this idea, tentatively called, "The Toxic Avenger: Triumph Of The Spill". It will debut in time for Christmas 2010, and feature the voice talents of Steve Carrell and Ben Stiller.

However, it may take more than a film about a crime-fighting, wise-cracking, oil-covered racoon to change the public's mind about the spill; in a recent poll, over 80% of Americans said they did not like oil spills, although 70% said they still liked oil, and wondered why it would do such a thing.

"When I told Obama to drill, I didn't know that this is what could happen," sobbed one Florida man. "I thought it meant we would have all the oil we needed forever, and nothing bad."

"If only we would've drilled for oil in places where it would be okay if a massive disaster happened," said another concerned citizen in Louisiana.

Few are hopeful that President Obama's address to the nation tomorrow will fix things, although the President is expected to give BP a stern look -- maybe even two.

"If the American people want an angry President, by golly, we're going to give them one," said White House Advisor David Axelrod. "I don't want to leak too much from the speech, but I can tell you that I wouldn't be surprised to hear the CEO of BP called a 'nancypants'."

Oil continues to flow into the water, and is now beginning to reach land. A BP Facebook status update describes the scene as "shiny and black like the new Xbox...kind of cool. :)"</text>

<title>Area Man Definitely Counting That Walk To The Mailbox As Today's Exercise</title>
<text>
After spending over ten consecutive hours sitting on the couch today, local man Jim Richardson decided to walk over 300 feet (round-trip) to his mailbox, burning over nine calories and fulfilling his goal of engaging in "some form of exercise" every day.

The 230 pound Richardson reported feeling "winded, but fufilled" after the postal excursion, which took upwards of 100 seconds.

"It's always hard to get motivated before a workout, but there's nothing like the feeling you get when it's over," said Richardson in a press conference this evening. "People talk about 'runner's high' -- I think I definitely have that right now, even though I didn't run so much as I slowly shuffled."

Richardson then excused himself while he ate a pack of cookies that contains just 100 calories -- only his fourth such pack since noon.

"Exercising is good, but you can't overeat, either," he explained. "Little snacks like this a few times every couple of hours are great for keeping the cravings down."

Although Richardson is by no means a fitness guru, he does fancy himself as somewhat of an expert, particularly in the sedentary lifestyles of many Americans -- a lifestyle he says he was once all too familiar with.

"There was a time in my life when I would go over ten hours just sitting on the couch, and then eventually just kind of fall asleep," he said with regret. "I felt like a real slob, but thankfully, those days are over."

After hitting a low point of attempting to aim his urine into a nearby bathroom to avoid having to walk there, Richardson says he began to shape up, using television shows like "The Biggest Loser" -- in which fat people are yelled at until they lose weight -- as inspiration.

"I knew I wasn't as bad as all those fatasses," he said. "I figured if I laughed at them enough, I could probably burn enough calories to get back into shape."

Now, the stay-at-home video editor says he routinely rouses himself from the couch to take food wrappers to the trash can (32 feet), empty his cat's litterbox (38 feet), or just walk a few laps around a portion of the living room while watching TV (7 feet per lap).

At the end of the day, Richardson says his fitness routine adds up to as much as 450 feet walked -- longer if he has to answer the door to let the grocery deliveryman in.

"Am I one of those big, muscle-bound guys you see in the movies who will probably be fat in a year or two anyway? Not yet," Richardson said with a wink. "But I did recently inherit two five pound dumbbells from my mother, so you might want to stay tuned!"

Update: Jim Richardson had a heart attack and sudden violent diabetes four minutes after his press conference concluded. He is now in the hospital and says he has no idea how this happened.</text>

<title>Obama's Temper Finally Broken By Daughter's Glass Of Spilled Juice</title>
<text>
Sources inside the White House say that President Barack Obama, infamous for his cool temper, finally "flipped out" yesterday when his eight-year-old daughter Sasha spilled a glass of grape juice all over the living room floor.

"God damnit, Sasha," Obama reportedly shouted, abruptly standing up from his easy chair and throwing down his newspaper in anger. "Watch what you're doing once in a god damn while."

Obama's wife Michelle then chided the President for what she viewed as an unnecessarily harsh response, to which Obama snapped, "Oh, shut the hell up, Michelle. Why don't you go bitch to Fox News about it?"

The President then muttered that he needed some scotch, and disappeared into the White House basement to listen to The Edgar Winter Group's "Frankenstein" at a volume that could be heard throughout most of the West Wing.

In the wake of the Gulf Coast oil disaster, some have criticized President Obama for his restrained, measured response, arguing that if only he yelled at everyone, the oil would dissipate.

"I want a President that takes charge," complained conservative commentator Bill O' Reilly last week. "Things would be a lot better right now if Obama would just take the stage at a press conference and scream, 'FUCKING THING SUCKS.'"

In a blog post on June 1st, former Alaskan Governor Sarah Palin pointed out, "If President Obama and other liberals want to drill for oil so bad, they should at least man up to the consequences. It's like I've always said: 'Solar energy, baby, solar energy.'"

Now, it appears that constant critiques like these have forced Obama to lose his cool, albeit with his clumsy daughter instead of BP, the corporation responsible for the spill.

For her part, Sasha Obama has volunteered to assume all costs involved in cleaning up the spill, although critics say that the allowance money she would use ultimately comes from the American taxpayers anyway. A member of the White House cleaning staff has estimated the bill at over $3; Sasha Obama has disputed that amount and is offering a $0.25 payout.

With Obama displaying an angry streak, will critics of his temperament now be silent? Not likely, says Bill O' Reilly, who believes that Obama has a lot to learn about anger management.

"You can't just go around yelling at people when things don't go your way," said O'Reilly. "Only an immature baby would do that."

"If President Obama and other liberals want to fly off the handle all the time, they should at least apologize for it," wrote Sarah Palin on Facebook. "It's like I've always said: 'Calm, rational discussions, baby. Calm, rational discussions.'"

Sources say Obama ended up falling asleep in the basement, and emerged this morning for breakfast. He appeared to be back to his old self; although he initially told Sasha she was punished and forbidden to spill any more juice, her lobbying and complaining convinced him to strike a compromise that allows her to spill some juice sometimes.</text>

<title>Why Do People Keep Buying Things That I Don't Like?</title>
<text>
Okay, I've made at least 675 tweets about this in the last 72 hours, but apparently, some of you people just aren't getting me. FAIL. So let's go over this one more time: everyone needs to stop spending money on products that I think are stupid.

It's like I was posting the other day in the comments section of an AppleInsider.com story: the iPhone is terrible. Why would anyone ever buy one? I'll tell you why: because people who buy iPhones are sheep, unlike people who buy Android phones, who are just making the smartest choice. (Do I, netguy89, have an Android phone? Uhhhhhhhh, yes? Call me crazy, but I like to own products that aren't for idiots. I made that very clear to my parents when they asked me what cell phone I wanted for graduating freshman year of college.)

But of course, all the sheep on AppleInsider couldn't handle it. They started arguing with me, trying to defend their purchase. Why would they do that? If I had a retarded iPhone, and someone said, "Hey, just so you know, the iPhone sucks and you probably only bought it because you want to suck Steve Jobs' cancer-ridden cock," I would think to myself, "This guy on the internet is judging my phone pretty harshly. I think there's something wrong with it." Is that so hard to do? Apparently it is.

The internet is so fucking predictable sometimes. You can tell when over 30 people on AppleInsider post basically the same thing: "The iPhone doesn't suck, Android does, we just formed a suicide cult for Steve Jobs, blah blah blah." How about you go ahead and name one thing wrong with any Android phone? Meanwhile, I've already explained about a hundred reasons why you should never buy an iPhone in this article alone. Go ahead, count them up. Or do you need an app for that?

This is all part of a bigger problem: for a bunch of different reasons (government over-regulation, sheeple, Steve Jobs), people constantly do things that I have repeatedly called out as being dumb. What's the point of the internet if nobody takes any of the valuable advice posted on it? I mean, I can understand basically anything, using these magical tools called Google and Wikipedia -- look them up sometime. But I can't understand how someone couldn't understand how they're massively wrong, and I'm completely correct.

Okay, maybe you don't want to listen to me, because maybe you're new to the internet, and my obvious experience with it scares and intimidates your feeble brain. That's fine. But at a bare fucking minimum, you need to do the following before you buy basically anything: 1) Search for that thing on Google; 2) Read what everyone is saying about it; 3) If any of those things are bad, don't buy it (this doesn't count if the thing you're buying is obviously cool, like an Android phone). If you think that's hard, you deserve a shitty iPhone.</text>

We once promised to answer your letters in a more timely manner. That was obviously a lie, or more accurately, a "trick promise", designed to see if you trust us. From now on, we will definitely answer them faster.

you have fucking issues, dude. get some help - Will

Josh: Come on, now, there's no need for that kind of language. I think we've all been at a point where the slowness of our computers caused us to bite through our fucking monitors.

Here's a surefire way to stop procrastinating. Take a picture of yourself now, in your 20's. Put it in a drawer and sit on your ass for exactly ten years. On the anniversary of the picture, take it out and look at it. Look in the mirror. Now get off your fat ass and do something! Problem solved. - Kilroy

Josh: What happens if you are in your 20s, but still look like hell and never do anything? I'll tell you what happens: you're ahead of the game.

(: Like the comics. At first when I came onto your site, I saw the text message article and I was just like....you're kidding me, but that's normal.. and then I found out more about you guys. Nice site, it's funny. - Kat

Josh: Oh yeah, we used to make comics!

I think ur a total Nob. Nice try, but I can see through this thinly disguised "Jazz music" story! We all know this is slightly about illegal immigration, but what some uninformed may not realize, is that this is actually a full out slandering of staff member Scott W, and his terrible inability to play the trumpet. you sir have very little class, and i hope you meet a fate worse than HRRRRRRRRNG!! - John Winthrop

Josh: Despite the fact that the person who wrote this story has never met Scott W., you're right. However, I submit that you're a total Nob, and HNNNRRAAHHTTT.

Might ask psychologist George Rekers if he would enlist in the military to serve "changing gay people straight" using his patented "reverse-pelvic-thrust-deep-penetration technique"...over and over again as many times as it takes. - kilroy

Josh: How could you say that? Dr. Rekers obviously just hired that young man for baggage duties. How would you like it if someone implied that you were gay every time you went to rentboy.com?

If my back wasn't all fucked up, I'd kick your asses for calling U2 a bunch of hacks. I'm the soul of the "one world" movement...which is a lot like a bowel movement with fancier glasses. - Bono

Josh: I don't know which is worse: "Bono" or "The Edge". At least with The Edge, you could constantly insert his name into sentences as you talked, and make him really irritated. Like, "Hey, you really edged out other guitarists with that solo!" Then he'll know what it's like to grow up with a name that's also a verb, and believe me, I am not joshing him on this.</text>

<title>Musician Struggles To Explain 5/4 Time Signature To Girlfriend</title>
<text>
Evan Dolmer, bassist for local avant-jazz band Unexpected Corn, expressed frustration and confusion after attempting fruitlessly to explain to girlfriend Gina Wagner the significance of the 5/4 time signature.

After a half-hour exegesis on basic rhythmic theory, Dolmer says he was reluctantly forced to change the subject to what the couple would do this summer -- plans that assuredly will not include playing music in 5/4.

Analysts such as Bob Gressley, another member of Unexpected Corn, speculate that the fatal flaw in Dolmer's description was the assumption that Wagner knew or cared about the concepts of "beat" and "measure".

"The part of the conversation I heard was pretty excruciating," said Gressley. "Gina, bless her heart, just could not fathom the beauty of the complex time signature, especially versus the simple and the compound signatures."

"I couldn't take anymore," continued Gressley, "when it became clear that she didn't know that 'the beat' is actually a more technical thing than 'what makes the song sound good or not'. I had to leave. I was sick."

Despite Dolmer's patient exposition, in which he explained that the "5" in 5/4 represents how many beats are played in each measure -- in this case, five -- and the "4" means that a quarter note gets one beat, Wagner continued nodding her head in obvious non-understanding until she was able to steer the conversation to the couple's weekend restaurant reservations.

"It was really cute, him trying to explain this weird musician terminology," said Wagner. "The whole thing really didn't make a lot of sense to me, especially because he kept mispronouncing the Dave Matthews Band, calling it the Dave Brubeck Quartet. But still, I appreciate him trying to make me a part of his world. And I really can't wait for dinner at [classy restaurant] Green Zebra, I hear it's great."

Said Dolmer about his attempts: "It's a pretty easy concept: most Western pop songs go ONE-two-three-four, ONE-two-three-four, or ONE-two-three, ONE-two-three, ONE-two-three; 5/4 just goes, ONE-two-three-four-five, ONE-two-three-four-five. Just imagine a Bulgarian dance and you've pretty much got it."

"It's as simple as that," he said.

Dolmer explained that further attempts to enlighten his significant other of the finer points of jazz music have been similarly unfructifying, though he admits failing to fully comprehend the things his girlfriend finds important.

"It's not that I don't like watching TV with her, it's just that I usually have band practice when 'Lost' is on," said Dolmer, "Plus, I missed the finale -- we don't have Tivo -- so she spent three hours trying to explain how it wrapped things up that I didn't understand to begin with. I suppose that discovering the identity of The Man in Black is as interesting to her as chord inversions and Dorian scales are to me, but if you ask me, that show made no sense."

While Dolmer has since abandoned the notion of conveying an understanding of unusual -- or even ordinary -- time signatures, beat patterns and jazz scales, he allegedly continues to impart on Wagner the wisdom necessary to understand why her favorite band, U2, are really just a bunch of hacks.</text>

<title>'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' Headed For Repeal; Social Conservatives Have Angry Gay Sex In Protest</title>
<text>
Outraged social conservatives, protesting the possibility of homosexuals being allowed to serve in the U.S. Army while being openly gay, marked this year's Memorial Day by staging hundreds of "Teabagging Parties" -- gatherings involving bouts of furious gay sex -- across the nation.

According to one out-of-breath demonstrator in Washington, D.C., the graphic protests are designed to show what could happen in the Army if "gay soldiers are allowed to hump each other all day."

"Yes, gays are already in the Army right now," admitted Reggie McGurty, one of the leaders of the D.C. area protest, as another man pretended to be gay by fondling McGurty's testicles. "But they aren't allowed to show it! If that happens, what you see happening between my legs will be the future of our once-proud-only secretly-gay Army."

Currently, the Army operates under the 'Don't ask, don't tell' (DADT) law, which bans homosexuals from fighting for their country if they don't pretend that they like vaginas. However, the House of Representatives voted last week to approve the repeal of the law, and the Senate is expected to approve a similar measure this summer, marking one of only two times in the past 13 months that the Senate has done anything whatsoever.

With DADT out of the picture, social conservatives fear that the Army could see openly gay members as early as next year, and consequently, the complete demise and fall of the U.S. in 2012 -- just as ancient Mayans predicted.

"We love our country so much, we're out here giving each other disgusting, unnatural pleasure," said McGurty, bending over. "And we'll keep at it until the government realizes that anyone who does things like this -- in real life -- is immoral, and has no business in the U.S. Army."

Besides "being/looking gross when they have sex", one of the main arguments that McGurty and his cohorts use against gays serving openly is the fact that once a homosexual is out of the closet, he may distract heterosexual soldiers, even to the point of playfully raping them in their sleep.

"I ask you this, America: can a man really fight against al-Qaeda when the night before, he awoke to find a penis in his mouth?" McGurty asked. "Having done this earlier today in the name of protest and freedom, I can confidently state that no, he cannot."

He spanked the buttocks of a nude man in front of him -- Bryan Fischer of the American Family Association -- to emphasize his point. Fischer closed his eyes and smiled in sheer pleasure in a fierce parody of what a real gay man might do upon being sexually spanked by another man.

McGurty also cited concerns about maintaining consistency in the Army in the midst of conflict, and suggested that Congress may want to delay the DADT repeal until after there are no U.S. troops anywhere in the world.

"Would I support it then? Maybe," said McGurty. "In a scenario where world peace broke out, and the U.S. dissolved its standing army along with the other nations of New Earth, then yes, I would accept open gays in the army."

"They still wouldn't be allowed to get married, though," he clarified. "I swear to God, I will stop that from ever happening in my lifetime, even if it means sleeping with 100 more men."</text>

In the time since we last answered your letters, the world has become a strange, frightening place, with socialists running amok threatening to take down The EV. Will this happen? It will unless you send us more letters! (We promise to answer them quicker this time.)

Josh: Cracker?! You can't use that word! That's our word.

Hi, I'm an undergrad app developer, and I actually love the concept of an app described in your article "Seven IPhone App Ideas Guaranteed to Make You Rich and Sexy". Don't worry, I get the satire! Is it at all possible that I would be allowed to create an app based on one of your ideas? Thanks, sorry if this is a stupid question - I'd love to bring your idea to life, but not if it's stepping on your intellectual rights. - Jordan

Josh: We wrote Jordan back personally and let him know that by all means, he should use our awesome ideas to make himself rich. Jordan is the second developer to find inspiration from that article, but so far, we haven't seen any finished EV-related apps. Could it be that the iPhone is being discontinued? It's likely.

Josh: That's a strange one to call "fake" on. Somewhere on the Internet, I could see someone attempting to make a career out of their superior bishop-beating skills.

Ah, HA! I knew it!!! The true nunber of gays in this country is actually half of the reported number. The other half are numb-nuts alcoholics: they are easily fooled, stay the course regardless and are subconsciously predispositioned to bend over and grab their ankles. You know....REPUBLICANS!!! - Light N. Loafers

Josh: I don't like the divisiveness of your conclusion. Can't we acknowledge that most politicians in all parties are basically super-gay?

The solution to the problem of having a song stuck in your head is to recognize each song is a "Freeze Frame" of time, encapsulated in your head..in your head, in your head, Zombie. So get with the program. It don't really matter to me, everybody has a right to be free of annoying songs in their heads. It begins with a smell, like teenaged spirit, then ignites in your brain until before you know it, you're burning down the house. Watch out, you might get what you're after if you try to overwrite one song with another. It's better to just pump up the volume and dance, dance to drown it all out. Then breath....breath in the air. Don't be afraid to care, but then again, when you feel it coming in the air tonight, just tell yourself, "I am Iron Man" and resist, even if it means not getting money for nothing and your chicks for free. Girl, you know it's true. One thing leads to another...and the wrong antedote is like a ball down your throat. But, if you take your time, do it right, they'll call you the breeze, and you'll keep moving down the road. But, after you say goodby yellow brick road, step out the front door like a ghost into the fog, contrast of white on white until no one notices that's you in the corner; that's you in the spotlight and you're losing your religion but you still don't know who let the dogs out. Who? Who? Oh CRAP!!! Let's start over! - Dr. Sigmond Fraud

Josh: I FUCKING HATE YOU. (But well done.)
