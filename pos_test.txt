<text>
BLOOMINGTON, INIn an effusive display of gratitude toward the local community, McDonalds custodian Kevin Daniels expressed his sincere thanks Wednesday to every customer who has thrown a half-filled cup of soda into any of his workplaces eight trash receptacles. Honestly, I cant say thank you enough to all of you out there for not finishing your large cups of Coke and Dr. Pepper and then just tossing them into the garbage, especially the ones with a lot of iceI appreciate those the most, said Daniels, noting that the multiple times per day he carries a heavy, sloshing, and oftentimes leaking garbage bag to the dumpster behind the restaurant he realizes just how lucky he is. I also want to give special praise to all of you who attempt to cram your soiled napkins and uneaten bits of burgers and Egg McMuffins into cans that are already overflowing. That truly makes my day. And dont let me forget all the times youve smeared ketchup on the flap of the trash can where it dried and needed to be scraped off. Cant wait to see what wonderful surprises the future has in store. Daniels added that given how happy and grateful he is for all that McDonalds customers do for him every day, he felt that it was extremely selfish of him to be making a full $8 an hour.</text>

<title>Congress Splits Into Male And Female Senators To Discuss Newest Reproductive Bill</title>
<text>
WASHINGTONTo better educate lawmakers on complex reproductive issues while also providing a safe, nonthreatening environment where they can speak up and ask questions without feeling self-conscious, the U.S. Senates 100 members were separated into male and female groups Thursday afternoon prior to arguments on S.1696, the Womens Health Protection Act. Theres always some giggling when the Senate debates a womans right to privacy and choice in reproductive matters, which is okay, but we find that everyones more at ease when they can talk about it with members of their own sex, Senate Sergeant at Arms Andrew B. Willison said as the female senators were led single-file down the hall into the Senate Appropriations Committee Room where they will learn about the proposed legislation from longtime congressional leader Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-MD). This way both the male and female senators can open up and ask anything they want about the bills provisions without fear of embarrassment or teasing. For many elected officials, this is their first real introduction to a womans reproductive rights, so we want to make the process as comfortable for them as possible. Sources confirmed that Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-GA) was given a religious exemption from the discussion after providing a note from his constituents.</text>

<title>Working Artist Has Developed Thick Skin For Sound Career Advice</title>
<text>
RICHMOND, VARefusing to let constructive, practical advice get him down, painter-sculptor Marcus Chilton told reporters Wednesday that he has developed pretty thick skin for the countless pieces of sound career guidance that friends and family have attempted to give him over the last five years. To stay focused on your art, you have to just tune people out when they start telling you all the reasonable, highly informed ways you should invest your earnings, start a retirement account, or otherwise supplement your income, said Chilton, adding that while he initially dwelled on the logical, well-thought-out recommendations others offered him, over time he has gradually become impervious to all helpful suggestions and sensible recommendations. Its not easy, but after a while you just have to put on the blinders and shrug off all the insightful advice that, if implemented, would help you live more comfortably and thrive as an artist. Chilton added that he has also developed a thick skin for people who look at the prices of his artwork, scoff, and then walk out of his studio.</text>
